ABC News reports on online surveys and “get paid to sites”.," <p>     If you want to make some extra money, you can try doing online surveys, completing offers, and using shopping services from home. You can get paid to do these things, and it can help you pay bills and debt while trying new products.   There are many companies that ask regular people to do surveys and Complete offers online.   Some popular survey websites include SurveyMonkey, Swagbucks, and InboxDollars.  </p> <p>     Online surveys are a great way to make some extra money each month, with many people earning $50-$100 per month. All you need to do is take a few short surveys and you could be earning this money in no time!   To increase your chances of being selected for the surveys, sign up for several survey sites.  </p> <p>     When you join a survey site, you provide your personal and demographic information. The survey site will not give this information to any other party.   The information is used to select people to participate in surveys about specific products and services. If you are chosen to be a panel member, you will get an email asking you to do a short survey to see if you are right for that particular survey.   If you meet the requirements, you will be asked to take a longer online survey in return for a reward.  </p> <p>     Survey compensation varies by company.   You could get a few dollars, which could help with paying your bills, or get free products in exchange for trying them and giving feedback about them.   Most surveys ""reward"" participants by entering them into a sweepstakes.  </p> <p>     I have taken a few surveys with the online survey sites I joined.   I was paid for three surveys ($15, $6, and $1 each) and entered into a sweepstakes for the other nine surveys (which I did not win).   It was easy and fun for me to answer the questions.  </p> <p>     Survey site members who have been doing this for a while, like Christa Alewine from Georgia, say they also get a lot of free stuff as a perk, like graham crackers or dog food.   Her children look forward to getting products in the mail to test at home and have even participated in some surveys for children (with parental approval).  </p> <p>     Christa's largest cash survey payment was $50 for a survey that took about 30 minutes to complete.   The average amount of money she gets for surveys that take 5 to 45 minutes is $1 to $3.   She thinks that she gets paid in cash for 10% of the surveys she completes, and gets free products for many of them.  </p> <p>     Christa started making money by playing online games for 30 minutes a day, and now she earns even more by completing surveys in that same amount of time.   For every product she tests, she gets to keep it and receive a $20 Amazon gift card, gift cards to restaurants or a few dollars in her Paypal account.  </p><h2>Make Sure the Survey Site Is Legit</h2> <p>     If you want to complete surveys on a daily basis, it is recommended that you join several survey sites (at least five to 10). This advice comes from experienced online survey participants.   You should register with an email address that you frequently check so you can respond to surveys quickly. Be honest and accurate when filling out the survey.   Do not be discouraged if you are not chosen as a survey participant after taking a few screening surveys- it may just take some time to find a survey company whose needs match your demographics.  </p> <p>     There are many reputable online survey sites, and you can find the top ones right on this website. You can also find more by searching for ""paid survey sites"" in a search engine.   There are sites that will charge a fee to give you a list of 400-500 survey sites, but you can find plenty of sites on your own without paying for a list.  </p> <p>     You should be aware that there are also many online survey sites that are actually just marketing tools used to obtain information from consumers.   If you sign up with these sites, they will sell your information to advertisers, and you will end up getting a lot of spam.   Before enrolling in a survey site, be sure to read the site's privacy policy to ensure the site is legitimate.  </p> <p>     A site that is posing as a survey site but is actually a marketing site would disclose in its privacy policy that it shares member information with other parties, according to ABC news.   If a site doesn't have a privacy policy link that is easy to find, it is probably not a good idea to use that site. It is better to find a site that has a clearly displayed privacy policy.   This means that the survey site will share your information with other parties unless you uncheck the ""yes"" box. If this box is unchecked, you may receive fewer unsolicited e-mails.  </p> <p>     A credible Web site's privacy policy will not share your personal information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional uses unless you provide consent or it is part of a specific program or feature that you can opt out of.  </p> <p>     If you see something you like at a store, but it's not on sale, ask the cashier for a price match. Many stores will price match items from competing stores.  </p>"

AEP tries to help customers by giving them extra time to pay their electric bills.  </p> <p>     American Electric Power will offer qualified customers the option to receive a PIPP Plus credit on their bill.   This program is similar to one that Texas had in the past, but it has been updated. The PIPP Plus program will help low-income customers by making monthly payments more affordable throughout the year.   A customer will need to agree to make regular payments, and if they keep up with their utility and electric bills then the AEP account will be credited to relieve the customer of the monthly bill.   This will also reduce the amount of debt that the customer owes.   To learn more about PIPP Plus, you can contact AEP.   If you have any questions or concerns about the regulation of utilities in Texas, you can contact the Public Utilities Commission of Texas at 1-800-686-7826 or the Texas Department of Development at 1-800-282-0880.  </p> <p>     The LITE-UP Texas Program is another one of the great resources that can help you save money on your energy bill.

To learn more about this program and to see if you are eligible, please call 1-866-454-8387.  </p> <p>     Community action agencies work with customers from all AEP companies to help them with applications and other needs.   If you are qualified and your application is accepted, you could receive up to $600 to help pay your bills.    The Community Action Agency screens applicants for financial assistance and determines who is eligible for aid.   In order to qualify, customers must live at the address where they want to receive service, be AEP Texas Central and North customers, and be responsible for paying their monthly electricity bill.   There are also income limits in place.  </p><h2>Financial assistance to pay AEP Texas utility bills</h2> <p>     The Comprehensive Energy Assistance Program is a program that helps low-income people with their energy bills. AEP Texas works with many different organizations to administer this program. Some of these organizations are non-profit community-based organizations, while others are private groups.   One way the government helps low-income families with energy costs is through the CEAP program. This program provides cash assistance and grants to help pay energy bills.  </p> <p>     The financial assistance can be used to help pay for monthly expenses.   In addition, if you are out of fuel or oil, or have received a disconnection notice from AEP, then you may qualify for help with your energy bills through the crisis component of CEAP.   Other services that are provided as part of this grant program include energy conservation and weatherization.  </p> <p>     The AEP offers the Texas Comprehensive Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, for customers who need help paying their electricity bills.

The service can help low-income homeowners who are struggling to pay their energy bills by providing them with an energy audit.   The program may provide for the installation of weatherization measures to increase energy efficiency of their home, based on the results of the test.  </p> <p>    The new AEP Texas Residential Hardship Program will provide a one-time $250 bill credit to eligible customers.

AEP's two companies often contribute large amounts of money to help fund programs that help those in need.  </p> <p>     The main focus of this help is for low income and working poor people who are facing an unexpected crisis.   This can include people who are elderly or have disabilities.   There is not a lot of money available to pay for things that are needed and much of the money that is available comes from people giving it as a gift.  </p> <p>     If you live in the area, you can give money to the Neighbor-to-Neighbor program.   They just need to select the ""bill assistance"" option on their monthly energy bill.   Your contribution will go towards helping those who are less fortunate in the AEP Texas service territory.  </p><h2>Free energy conservation measures to save money on electric and utility bills</h2> <p>     You can save money on your American Electric Power energy bills by making your home more energy efficient.

This means that the person you designate will be contacted before the account is disconnected.   This program allows someone else to be notified about an electric service disconnection on behalf of a low income customer.   This service is usually used by people who are sick or elderly, but anyone can use it and benefit from it.  </p> <p>     An authorized third party on the account will receive copies of the participant's utility bills if they are at risk of having their electric service disconnected due to nonpayment of their energy bill.   You don't need to pay the bill, but you'll get a notification about it.  </p><h2>How to get assistance from AEP in Texas</h2> <p>     If you want to learn more about these programs, you can call American Electric Power (AEP Texas) at 1-877-373-4858, or you can call a local community action agency.  </p>"
How the Affordable Connectivity Program Increases Internet Access for Low-Income Families.," <p>     The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) provides low-income families with significant discounts on their internet services, or even free service.   The government benefit is intended to ensure that people who have low incomes can use the internet for work, school, or even personal use.   The Affordable Internet Connectivity Program provides low-cost internet access to eligible households. To apply, visit the program website and complete the online application. The benefit program can help pay for a laptop, computer, or Chromebook.  </p> <p>     For many people, using the internet has become a daily routine for things such as work, bills, banking, business, education, doctor visits, and communication with friends and family.   Many people need laptops for online learning and remote work.   The internet has become a near-essential part of life, but for many households struggling to make ends meet, it can be unaffordable.   This means that the cost of having internet service is too high for many households that live paycheck to paycheck or that are on government assistance.  </p> <p>     This program provides low-income households with internet service and a device.   This assistance is offered to families with low or moderate incomes.  </p> <p>     The American Connectivity Program (ACP) is a government initiative that provides financial assistance to low-income households in order to help cover the cost of Internet service. The program offers up to $30 per month toward Internet service for households not on qualifying tribal lands, or up to $75 for those on qualifying tribal lands.     The program provides a one-time payment of up to $100 to a household for the purchase of a tablet, laptop, Google Chromebook or desktop computer.   The government provides laptops for free to eligible citizens. To learn more about the program and see if you qualify, visit the website.  </p><h2>Who is eligible</h2> <p>    Discounts on ACP services and devices are available for families with moderate incomes.   A household is a group of people who live together and share their income and expenses.   This means that two people who live in the same house cannot both get the benefit.  </p> <p>     To qualify for ACP benefits, a household's income must be at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines.   This means that a 4-person household must have an annual income of less than $60,000 in order to qualify for the program. The cutoffs for qualifying for the program will change from year to year.   This means that if you are a service provider that offers low-income internet programs, your household may qualify for the program.  </p> <p>     A household is eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program if at least one member of the household is receiving a Federal Pell Grant, SNAP benefits, Medicaid, SSI, Federal Public Housing Assistance, Veterans Pension or Survivor Benefits, or WIC benefits.   A household is eligible for the Lifeline program if they participate in the National School Lunch or School Breakfast Program.  </p> <p>     Lifeline is a program that helps low-income people afford communication services. It can help pay for phone bills, even wireless internet.   Lifeline subscribers can get cheaper rates on certain phone plans, internet service, and combined voice-broadband packages.   There is help available for people who need assistance paying their phone bill.  </p> <p>     The $75 service discount is available to anyone who resides on tribal land, regardless of whether they are enrolled tribal members.   If a household receives Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance, Tribal TANF, or participates in Tribal Head Start or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, they will automatically qualify for the Affordable Internet Connectivity Program.  </p> <p>      Landlords of multi-unit dwellings such as apartments that pay for internet service can still apply for ACP benefits for their tenants.   This means that the ACP program is available to tenants/people who rent.   If you are in a situation where you do not have access to the internet, you should ask your landlord to talk to the internet service provider to see if there are any benefits that you and other tenants may be able to receive.   This means that people who live in group homes and have a low income can also get help from the ACP.  </p> <p>     This means that if you have unpaid bills or bad credit, you can still sign up for the ACP.   This means that more homes will be able to have access to cheap internet service, even if they have had trouble paying for it in the past.  </p><h2>How to apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program</h2> <p>     To get ACP benefits, you usually have to sign up for the ACP program and then tell your internet service provider that you want the benefits.   The Affordable Connectivity Program offers two ways to apply for assistance. You can either submit your application online at AffordableConnectivity.gov, or you can print out an application to submit by mail.  </p> <p>     Submitting something online will usually result in a quicker response than other methods.   You will hear back about your application either by mail or by email, depending on if you left an email address.  </p> <p>     If you participate in programs like SNAP or Medicaid, your family will qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program.   The eligibility for the program may be confirmed by checking the program's database. If you cannot confirm your eligibility with that method, you will need to provide documentation like a benefit award or approval letter.   Pell Grant recipients can provide a screenshot from the StudentAid.gov website that shows they received a grant for the current school year.  </p> <p>     If you are currently receiving benefits from Lifeline, you will not automatically start receiving benefits from the ACP.   Lifeline subscribers must either contact their existing internet provider and opt-in to the program or enroll in the ACP.   Households that get Lifeline benefits can also get ACP benefits. They can use these benefits for the same service or for different services from different providers.   This means that the Lifeline discount on your telephone service bill would go to the telephone service provider, while the ACP discount on your internet bill would go to the internet service provider.  </p> <p>     After your ACP application has been approved, you will need to contact your internet service provider so that you can either select an internet plan or have the discount applied to your current plan.  The benefits are determined by the provider and may change at any time. To be eligible, customers must maintain their account in good standing and use their provider for all ACP work.   The company may ask you to fill out a short form.   This means that not all companies offer the ACP service, so you may need to check with multiple companies to see if they are available in your area.  </p><h2>Receiving benefits from ACP</h2> <p>     After you qualify for the ACP service benefits, your internet bill will go down by $30 if you already have the service.   The service provider will directly receive the benefit.   This means that if your internet service costs less than $30, you will not get any additional money from the government's Affordable Connectivity Program.   If your internet service costs more than $30, you will owe the remaining amount.  </p> <p>     If you subscribe to a bundle of services from the same provider, you will need to pay for TV service separately plus any internet service above the $30 discount.   This means that the ACP program will not cover the costs of a cable TV or streaming service.  </p> <p>     If you want to get the discount for buying a device that can connect to the internet, you need to buy it from your internet service provider.   You will need to pay at least $10, but no more than $50, for the device.  </p><h2>Internet access is needed by everyone</h2> <p>     The recent changes in the economy and the way people learn, mostly as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, have made it so that people have to rely on the internet and technology more than ever for work, school, shopping, socializing, and everyday life.   The federal government's Affordable Connectivity Program provides more assistance to low-income households than the Emergency Broadband Benefit program.   Kids and adults need access to the internet for school and work, respectively.  </p> <p>     The ACP program makes it possible for everyone to have access to the important communication resource.   This program will provide low income families with affordable internet and computers. If you have questions about the Affordable Connectivity Program or want to apply for benefits, go to AfforableConnectivity.gov.  </p>"

Assistance with child and daycare costs in Alabama.," <p>     There are government programs that help low income, working families in Alabama with the cost of daycare. These programs either pay for part of the cost of daycare, or provide vouchers for free child care at approved centers.

I feel most successful when I have a plan to follow, with a defined purpose and clear objectives. This helps me to stay focused and motivated, and to see my progress more easily.   This means that people who are already getting help from Alabama DHR to pay for their child care cannot apply for this program. This means that if the guardian meets other conditions, they may be able to get help from the government to pay for child care.   Other caregivers, not just the child's parents, can benefit from this.  </p> <p>     There are age restrictions in place as well.   Parents in some counties must work or participate in a work program, and also have a child under the age of 13.

This program will help eligible parents pay for part of the cost of the program. The participant will need to pay the balance.   The amount offered will be based on how much money your family makes and how many people are in your family.  </p> <p>     Parents can choose any child care provider that meets the minimum standards set by their town or county.   You can even select a family member to be your certified caretaker, provided they meet the requirements.   The parents also need to be willing and able to accept cash payments from the Alabama Childcare Resources program.   Any provider you select will need to register with Childcare Resources (if they have not done so yet) before they can begin receiving payments or subsidies.  </p> <p>     This means that families will need to pay a portion of the cost of their child care.   The fee you have to pay is usually based on your family size, the number of kids you have, and your total income and assets. Certain low income households may be eligible to receive free daycare from government assistance programs.   Another important factor is how much money the government is willing to give to support the project.

Free phones and assistance paying cell phone bills in Alabama.," <p>     There are two main programs in Alabama that can help households with paying their phone bills or that give a free cell phone, tablet, or wireless device.   This program provides a subsidy for low income families, seniors, the disabled and struggling households to help pay for their communication services.   A combination of free government phones, tablets or devices as well as discounts or even direct financial aid is given.  </p> <p>     Both of these assistance programs are required to be offered in the state by the federal government.   These resources are for families who have low incomes or who receive some form of public assistance, such as food stamps, LIHEAP, Medicare, Medicaid, section 8 or other aid.   How can I get free or discounted cell or home phone service?  There are a few ways to get free or discounted cell or home phone service. You can check with your local government for programs that offer free or discounted phone service for low-income residents. You can also contact your phone service provider to see if they offer any discounts or assistance programs for low-income customers.  </p> <p>     The goal of these Alabama low income telephone programs is to ensure that every homeowner or renter in the state has some form of access to emergency communication, such as a free government phone. This is regardless of their income.     This program provides financial assistance to people who may have difficulty paying their bills. This can include people on fixed incomes, people with disabilities, or people who have lost their jobs.   Lifeline provides a discount on monthly telephone service for eligible customers.  </p><h2>Assistance with phone bills in Alabama</h2> <p>     Lifeline offers discounts and financial assistance to eligible customers.   In order to receive a discount, you must meet one of two conditions.  So, depending on the family size, that's different. And that's based on family income and composition.  Lifeline is a program for families with very low incomes, usually between 100 and 150% of the federal poverty levels for a household. The amount of assistance a family receives depends on the size of the family and their income.   This means that people who meet the stated condition may be eligible for the position.  </p> <p>     Individuals who receive government benefits can also get help with their phone bills or get free cellular service.   A family may qualify for assistance if they receive low income energy assistance from LIHEAP, Medicaid, SNAP Food Stamps, TANF, SSI disability or Section 8 voucher.   If you are having trouble with your phone service, the phone company may be able to help you.   If you are receiving public assistance, you may be eligible for the Lifeline program.  </p><h2>Free government phones or help paying for fees</h2> <p>     Link-Up is the second assistance program in Alabama that provides financial help to low-income families and individuals to pay for their phone service.   This company provides a discount for the installation of a new phone, or maybe even for the activation costs for a wireless service.   This means that by using this service, households can save up to half of what they would normally spend on this type of expense.  </p> <p>     If you need help, you need to go through the phone company you're using.   A local community action agency or social service department can provide referrals to Lifeline, but they do not process the applications.   Most phone companies in Alabama are participating, including Virgin Mobile, T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, Frontier, Global Connection of America, and many others.   If you want to know more, call them.  </p> <p>     The amount of money that a company will take off of the original price of something will depend on that company, the applicant's income and other conditions. It will usually cost about $10 per month.   This only applies to the basic service and not any extra features, like call waiting.   If a customer asks for additional features for their phone, they will need to pay for those costs themselves.  </p> <p>     Only one telephone per home or apartment is eligible for this program.   This means that you can use a home phone or a cellular line, but not both, or you can use a tablet or a computer, but not both.   The limit for people residing at an address in Alabama is one unit.  </p><h2>Applying for phone bill help or free cell service</h2> <p>     The applicant needs to call a phone company.   Other companies need to offer assistance like AT&T, Verizon, T Mobile, and Safelink.   When requesting help from your provider, note that some will call it ""Basic"" Lifeline.   Some companies offer an enhanced plan that provides greater savings.   You should always ask your phone company how much it will cost to make international calls.  </p> <p>     The agency that regulates utilities across the state is the Alabama Public Service Commission.   If you are a consumer that is not receiving a discount or free government phone, or if you are having issues with your phone company, you can call the commission at 1-800-392-8050.   They will help with resolving disputes and answering technical questions.  </p>"

Some organizations are directly administered by Alabama Power.   If you're struggling to pay your utility bills, Alabama Power may be able to help. They offer programs that can help low-income families keep their power on, or prevent their power from being shut off.  </p> <p>   Project Share is a non-profit organization that helps low-income families with their utility bills. They are funded by donations from customers and local businesses.   The American Red Cross is in charge of the program that Alabama Power is a part of.   The main people who will get help from this program are people who have a low income or no income, seniors, people with disabilities, and families who are in a difficult situation.     If you want to apply for Project Share or find out more about it, contact your local American Red Cross office.  </p> <p>     The requirements for being eligible for Project SHARE are set by the American Red Cross.

Project SHARE is a resource that helps people in need pay their energy bills.   All contributions made can be deducted from taxes, and the money goes to the American Red Cross. The Red Cross then decides who gets the money.  </p> <p>    You may be able to work out a payment plan or extended payment option with your utility company.

Customers who meet certain qualifications can get a monthly discount of around $14.50 on their utility bills. If you are interested or qualified, you can apply for the discount by calling 1-800-245-2244, or stopping by any office.  </p> <p>     The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Weatherization Assistance Program are both U.S. Department of Energy programs that help low-income families save money on their energy bills. LIHEAP provides financial assistance to help low-income households pay their heating and cooling bills. Weatherization Assistance Program funds are used to make homes more energy efficient by improving insulation and sealing air leaks.   These resources are designed to help low-income families, with a focus on those who are most vulnerable.  </p> <p>     The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides financial assistance to low-income households to help them pay their energy bills.   If you have money, you can pay your bills. If you don't have money, you can get disconnected. A crisis fund can help you if you can't pay your bills.   Every so often, people may be offered money to buy things like fans or air conditioners.  It helps low-income families reduce their energy costs by improving their home's energy efficiency.   This program will provide free energy updates and improvements to people's homes, such as caulking and insulation.  </p> <p>     Budget Billing is not a form of financial assistance, but it can help people plan and budget their expenses more effectively.   Predicting your utility bills and expenses is a good way to plan ahead.   If you are able to plan ahead, you may be able to avoid some difficult situations.   Budget Billing is a service offered by Alabama Power that evens out the lows and highs of your electric bills by giving you an average price to pay each month.   This means that the average person spends this much money in a year.  </p> <p>   The company will work with you to make a billing plan that is specifically for you and what you need.   They will analyze your past energy usage in your current location and base it on that.   The energy provider can estimate your average monthly energy bills and use, so you will have a good estimate of your energy expenses even before you move.  </p><h2>Contact information for help from Alabama Power</h2> <p>       If you need help conserving energy or paying your bill, call Alabama Power at 1-800-245-2244 to speak to a representative.

LIHEAP and weatherization in Alabama.," <p>     The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance free government grant program provides assistance to struggling families in Alabama with paying utility bills.   Both cooling and heating bills can be paid with the goal of making someone more energy self-sufficient and reducing their vulnerability to energy needs or a crisis.   LIHEAP is often combined with free weatherization services in order to help low-income families save money on their energy bills. Weatherization services can include adding insulation to a home, caulking and sealing windows and doors, and making other improvements to the home that will help reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool it.   The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federally-funded program that helps low-income households with their home energy bills. The Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) administers the program in Alabama.  ADECA provides weatherization services to eligible households in Alabama. The weatherization program is designed to improve the energy efficiency of homes and to reduce the cost of heating and cooling bills for low-income families.  </p> <p>     The purpose of this program is to help those who may not be able to afford to keep their power on. This includes low income families, the elderly, and disabled individuals.   This will also help save money on energy bills for low-income families in the long run.  </p> <p>     The two grant programs are funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.   There are two ways to get help with your heating and cooling bills in Alabama. You can either go through a local community action agency or a nonprofit agency. There is also emergency LIHEAP assistance available.   There will be a location in your county that will be in charge of both the low-income energy bill and the weatherization programs for your town or city.  </p><h2>Low income utility and cooling bill assistance</h2> <p>     Many low-income families struggle to pay their energy bills, especially if they have a child, senior, or disabled member in the home. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps these families by providing financial assistance to help cover the cost of their energy bills. LIHEAP focuses on helping those with the lowest incomes and the highest energy costs or needs, taking into account family size.   The goal is to help people maintain power and air conditioning during the hot summer months in Alabama, or during a cold stretch in the winter. We offer both regular and emergency assistance.  </p> <p>   The Alabama Charitable Trust Programs also provides assistance with cooling, air conditioning, and heating bill assistance.  A family may only receive one Crisis payment per heating season, defined as November 1 to April 30. A Crisis is defined as a situation where someone is faced with a disconnection, or at least one household member has a documented health problem or medical condition that would be exacerbated by a disconnection.   A family who is in danger of being disconnected from their heat or has a member with a health problem that would be made worse by a loss of heat is eligible for a one-time payment during the heating season to help them pay their heating bills.  </p> <p>     There is a formal process to apply for funding, and help is given to those who apply first.   Make sure to apply as soon as possible.   This means that you will need a bill from the utility company that provides your power, cooling, electricity, gas, or propane.   All household members must provide proof of income.   The application for LIHEAP, along with all necessary verifications and documentation, needs to be submitted to the designated non-profit agency in your Alabama county.  </p> <p>     The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides eligible households with help paying their home energy bills. LIHEAP is a grant that helps low-income households with energy costs. The program provides one-time assistance to eligible households to help pay their heating and cooling bills.   The money does not go to the person or family who is applying for assistance, but instead goes to their utility company or energy provider. The customer may see a credit on their account.  </p><h2>Alabama energy conservation programs</h2> <p>     The Alabama Weatherization Assistance Program helps low-income families by providing funding for things like home energy improvements.   There are organizations in every state that work to conserve energy, and this program is paid for by the federal government.  </p> <p>     The main goal is to help people save money.   The Weatherization Assistance Program helps people reduce their energy costs, with a focus on low-income households, families with children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.   The program is designed to help make an applicants primary residence more energy efficient, whether it is a traditional home, condo, or mobile home.   This will also help keep the applicant safe and healthy.  </p> <p>       Some of the improvements offered by the free Alabama weatherization assistance program can include making HVAC system tune-ups and repairs, making it so outside air infiltration into the conditioned space of the home is lessened, installing attic, wall and floor insulation, sealing duct work, working on doors, and replacing incandescent light bulbs with highly efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs and also repairing leaky and/or faulty windows.   A contractor will visit the home to check for any health and safety concerns and to offer any recommendations, at no cost.  </p> <p>     The state does receive funding from the United States Department of Energy's (DOE), however applications are also processed by community action agencies, and the non-profits will usually sign people up for LIHEAP and weatherization at the same time.     One key benefit of energy-efficient homes is that they can reduce energy costs for families, especially low-income families who may have a high energy burden. This can help lessen the need for future financial assistance.  </p><h2>Applying for LIHEAP energy bill help or free weatherization services in Alabama</h2> <p>     There are government programs that provide financial assistance to low-income families and individuals. These programs are typically based on need, meaning that recipients must have a low income in order to qualify.

Alachua County eviction assistance.," <p>     The eviction and rehousing assistance in Alachua County comes from different sources, like the government grants from ESG and funding from United Way.   There are many organizations that help the homeless or those at risk of eviction.  </p> <p>     There are many requirements that must be met in order to be eligible for assistance from these programs.

Other requirements for receiving aid will be based on income, attendance at case management and credit counseling services, and more.  </p><h2>Alachua County agencies that administer eviction and rehousing assistance</h2> <p>     There are several options to try in the region.   They include the Coalition For The Homeless, which connects people in need with housing and shelter resources.   In order to receive help, individuals will need to go through a screening and referral process.   Some of the ways people have come up with to solve this problem include the following.   The government may give money to a landlord to help with rent that is owed.   If a client is facing eviction and is unable to pay their utility or water bill, the staff can help them set up a payment plan to delay a shut-off. This will allow the eviction to be postponed.  </p> <p>     The homeless in Alachua County can also get help from the Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry in Alachua County.

Some non-profit organizations that work with the Homeless Coalition often only have a limited amount of grant money available, so the assistance they are able to provide may be targeted by some of the agencies involved in this.  </p> <p>     This means that each request for assistance with eviction is often handled differently.   We look at each application carefully.   One should never expect to be given help.   No one has the right to be given support, and a non-profit organization will only provide help if it has the resources available and if the person asking for help meets the necessary requirements.  </p> <p>     The goal of homeless prevention is to stop the foreclosure or eviction and ensure that the Alachua County resident has the support they need for stability.     Case management is the process of coordinating services and resources for people who need them.   The United Way and their partners are important in this process.   Everything is arranged in a way that makes it easy to get the help that you need, whether it is help with budgeting, assistance in obtaining legal advice, or job programs.  </p> <p>     Grants from ESG or another source will only be used when the underlying cause of the problem is addressed.

Alamance County Community Services Agency assistance programs.," <p>       The Community Services Agency provides services to low-income residents in Alamance and Caswell counties.   The non-profit organization can help people with basic needs like food and shelter, as well as long term case management and educational services.   For more information on their services, see the information below.  </p> <p>     A food emergency is when you don't have enough food to feed yourself or your family. When this happens, you can turn to emergency food assistance. This is a service that provides food to people in need during an emergency.  The organization depends on food from the USDA and donations from the public to run food pantries and soup kitchens. There may also be seasonal resources available, such as Christmas or Thanksgiving programs.   A three-day supply of groceries is provided free of charge.  </p> <p>     There are also meal sites where people can come together to eat.   The purpose of these locations is to help senior citizens from Alamance County with their nutritional needs, and they may receive free meals and access to other activities, such as information on applying for Medicare and government benefits.  </p> <p>     The nutritional supplement program provides free food and related items to low-income persons suffering from health issues.   People who are 60 years old or older and have a doctor's certification may be eligible for subsidies for their needs.   Some assistance is also given to individuals who are less than 60 years old.   This program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Home and Community Care Block Grant, Henderson County Hunger Coalition, and local donations.  </p> <p>     If you need help finding housing, you can talk to someone at your local HUD office. They may be able to refer you to the section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. This program can help you pay for rent.   This housing assistance is available to low-income individuals and families across North Carolina.   The program provides financial assistance to help low-income households afford rent. It is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  </p> <p>     To be eligible for the program, applicants must have an income level below 50% of the area median in Alamance and other counties.   In addition to paying 30% of their adjusted monthly income toward their total utility and rental expenses, tenants are also responsible for any other associated costs.  </p> <p>     The amount of money the landlord is still owed can be reduced if the person gets help from section 8, but there is a limit to how much section 8 will pay. The apartments are inspected to ensure compliance with minimum standards set by HUD before leases and housing assistance payment contacts are signed by the tenant.  </p> <p>     Families and individuals in the section 8 HCV program who have low incomes face annual evaluations to determine if they still qualify for the rental assistance.   Every year, case managers from Alamance County Community Services Agency or a local public housing authority inspect the housing quality standards of units and may adjust how much money participants contribute to rent.   The non-profit may have a list of affordable housing options for the general public.  </p> <p>     The non-profit community action organization also offers a self-sufficiency service for families enrolled in the program.   The goal of this resource is to help families become self-sufficient by providing case management and setting aside money for a down payment on a home.   The Alamance or Caswell County Community Services Agency will have staff that can provide information about this service.  </p> <p>     This service helps people who need transportation to get jobs.   The social service department and Alamance County Community Services work together to provide cars for people who need them for work.  </p> <p>     Alamance County Community Services Agency's self-sufficiency program helps individuals and families in crisis to become economically stable. This service is designed to help low-income families with children by providing affordable rental housing, employment, low cost childcare, budgeting, healthcare and increased household income.   An additional focus is on helping people apply for grants for expenses related to housing, such as rent or security deposits.  </p> <p>     There may only be a small amount of money available from grants to pay for things like uniforms, transportation, food and other expenses.     In addition to funding, the Alamance County Community Services Agency may provide education and refer clients to other agencies to help them achieve their goals.  </p> <p>   The IDA account also offers free financial workshops on budgeting and related topics for the public.   The self-sufficiency program is funded by the state through the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), with additional funding periodically available.  </p> <p>     The Community Services Agency has applications for state and federal utility bill assistance programs for residents of North Carolina.   The main resources for energy assistance come from grants for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and energy conservation from weatherization.   The HARRP air conditioning repair program helps people in need of air conditioning repair assistance.  </p> <p>       The goal of these services is to make sure that families who have low incomes can afford to keep their homes warm in the winter and cool in the summer. This is especially important in areas like Alamance and Caswell County, where the weather can be extreme.   The money can be used for things like paying bills and fixing up a home.  </p> <p>     There are also transportation options in some towns.   In Burlington, NC, non-profits offer a variety of services in partnership with human-service agencies. These services are designed to help those in need, and consolidate resources in order to provide the best possible service.

They can connect you with the services and programs you need.   The non-profit and its case managers can be a great source to learn about local resources such as for food stamps or maybe even disability applications.   The agency will not necessarily process the forms, but they can tell families where to go for help.  </p> <p>     The Alamance County Community Services Agency is responsible for the Head Start and Early Head Start programs in the area. The programs offered serve children up to the age of five and focus on education, social services, medical care, parental involvement, nutrition and health.   There are several different education centers in the area.  </p> <p>     Wrap-Around services are additional services that are available at centers for parents who are working or in job-related training. These services can include longer classroom days and additional months of childcare.   Head Start and Early Head Start are free programs, but Wrap-Around requires fees that are based on how much money a person makes.  </p> <p>     In addition, there is a Head Start program available for preschool children who live in remote areas, are disabled, or whose families prefer to keep them at home.   A teacher visits the homes of enrolled children every week to work with the children and their families.   The requirements to be eligible for center-based or home-based Head Start and Early Head Start programs are the same.   Some things that can affect if someone gets food assistance are how old they are and how much money their family makes.  </p> <p>   If you want to know more about these programs, you can call the center at (336) 229-7031.

Alaska Heating Assistance Program and weatherization services.," <p>     The Department of Energy and the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation help low income customers with energy bills and conserving energy.   The two main programs offered by the government to help with energy costs are the Heating Assistance Program (HAP) and weatherization.   Two resources that provide grants to low-income families and seniors in Alaska are the Denali Commission and the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.  </p> <p>     From October onwards, people who may struggle to pay their heating bills can apply for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Alaska, this program is known as Heating Assistance.   The amount of money available for assistance is determined by the federal government, and not everyone who needs help will be able to receive it every year.  </p> <p>     HAP can help people with low incomes pay for their winter heating bills.   The deadline to apply is October, but there are a few exceptions.   Those households in Alaska with elderly or disabled members may apply for assistance from September 1 through April 30.   The program will process benefit checks on November 1.   Some people are in danger of running out of fuel or being disconnected, and this crisis component is for them.   The crisis component can be paid out quickly.  </p> <p>     The Alaska Subsidized Rental Housing Utility Deposit (SRHUD) is another option. This deposit helps cover the cost of utilities for low-income households.   This will help a household pay for a deposit on utilities.   This program is designed for families who are moving into Section 8 or subsidized rental housing.   This option is for people who have their heat included in their rent.   A big difference is that applications for the Subsidized Rental Housing Utility Deposit are accepted and processed all year long.   If you need help, you can call us at 1-888-804-6330, or if you're in Anchorage, you can call us at 269-5777.  </p> <p>     This means that people can go to any Department of Public Assistance office to fill out an application for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

The goal of the program is to make homes more energy efficient and safe.  </p> <p>     Many homes can save on their winter heating costs by up to 35% due to weatherization.   This will also improve safety and potentially extend the life of buildings in Alaska's difficult climate.   These services can help improve your home's energy efficiency.   The service is also available to renters and homeowners in the state with approval from their landlord.  </p> <p>     To be found qualified, applicants will need to meet a number of conditions.

An example of this may be if someone in the household lost their job and the household could no longer afford their home.  </p> <p>     This means that if you owe rent for multiple months, you will only receive enough money to cover one or two of those months.

The person asking for help must be able to show that they will be able to pay their rent again soon, so that they don't end up getting evicted again.  </p> <p>     Although a homeless family may be self-sufficient, it may not be possible to find housing for them in a short period of time.   A program like transitional housing can provide a faster solution in some cases.

Assistance programs from Alliant Energy in Wisconsin.," <p>     The three main programs that Alliant offers to help individuals with their utilities are the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the Weatherization Program, and the Hometown Care Energy Fund.   Customer service representatives from the energy provider can tell you about different payment programs and plans.   I would like to speak to customer service, please.  </p> <p>     The Hometown Care Energy Fund can help with utility and heating bills through your local community action agency.   The funds are intended to help ensure people do not need to make the difficult decision between paying their utility bills and providing food for their families. This will help people be more financially stable and not have to worry about choosing between necessities.   The help that is provided is confidential and free.  This means that the main people this program is for are low income families, disabled people, and old people.  </p> <p>     The Hometown Care Energy Fund is mostly funded by donations from businesses, customers, employees, and shareholders from Wisconsin, with additional contributions from Alliant Energy.   If you donate, the money will go towards paying the bills of people in need who live near you. The community action agency will oversee where the money goes.  </p> <p>     These non-profit agencies usually have applications open for most of the services that are listed on this page, such as LIHEAP.   They give money to customers who need it.   Both people who live on farms and regular homeowners can get help from the state of Wisconsin to pay their gas and electric bills.  </p> <p>     This program is not for just anyone.   There are several qualifications that applicants must meet.   Some other things that are needed are   If you are a customer of Alliant Energy and you are unable to work because you are disabled, you may be eligible for assistance.   This means that if you are 60 years or older and have a fixed income, you may qualify for this.   If you live in Wisconsin and your household income is low, you may qualify for Hometown Care Energy Fund. This program is designed to help low-income households with energy costs.   Other groups of people who may be eligible for assistance include renters or people who are experiencing extreme financial hardship.   There may not be any restrictions on these cases based on income, age or eligibility.  </p> <p>     Customers need to have a good history of paying their bills on time.   They will look at how much and when you have paid in the past, and that will help them decide if you qualify for assistance.   The Hometown Fund is not meant to be a long-term solution or government benefit.   If you have never tried to pay your bills in the past, it is doubtful that Hometown Care will help you.  </p> <p>     The state of Wisconsin and the United States Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance service will work together to help low income families save money on their utility and heating bills. This will allow families to have more money to spend on other necessary expenses.   This free program will help improve the overall energy efficiency of homeowners.   It will also help seniors and others improve the health and safety of their home or apartments.  </p> <p>     The contractors will come to your house and assess what work needs to be done.   The providers will then install equipment to make your residence more energy efficient.   All improvements and upgrades are offered for free.  </p> <p>     All the workers on this project are highly skilled and have the appropriate certification for the job.   They will install measures that will save customers money in the long run in the homes of qualified Alliant Energy customers.   Weatheization includes making upgrades such as repairing or replacing furnaces (that are not emergency cases), adding insulation, reducing air leaks, sealing windows, and offering advice and energy education services.  </p> <p>     If you are a low-income household in Wisconsin, you may also be eligible for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).   This federal government funded program can help people pay for their heating and electric bills. This includes both in the winter as well as summer cooling bills.

The program is funded by Alliant Energy, its customers, and employees.  </p> <p>     There are many reasons why people may not be able to keep up with their bills.   This can happen when someone is unemployed or has unanticipated debts, like if they have a medical emergency.   Some families may struggle to pay their energy or heating bills for various reasons. Perhaps they lost their job and are now unemployed, or maybe they are going through a tough financial situation. Whatever the reason may be, falling behind on these types of bills can be difficult for families to overcome.   Some people may have to choose between paying their bills and buying food.  </p> <p>     The Hometown Care Energy Fund is a financial assistance program offered by Alliant Energy to Iowa residents.

The customer needs to have natural gas or electric service.  </p> <p>     The applicant must also be over the age of 60 and have a fixed income with no other source of funding.   Individuals with disabilities may be unable to work and earn an income, which can lead to economic insecurity. Disabilities can be temporary or permanent, and can range from mild to severe.   The energy company Alliant has a fund to help pay energy bills for customers in need, and one of the factors that determines who gets help from the fund is whether the customer has a history of making payments on time.   If you've been paying your bills on time in the past, that can help your application get approved.   This means that if you are a renter and you pay your own energy bills, you may be eligible for this program if your income falls within the guidelines set by the federal government.  </p> <p>     To contribute, call 1-800-255-4268.   Certain non-profit organizations, such as the Salvation Army in Iowa, may have additional information on the program.  </p> <p>     Alliant partners with community action agencies and the U.S. Department of Energy to provide free conservation services through the weatherization program.   This federal resource will also help low-income families make their homes more energy efficient, whether they rent or own their home.     The goal is to help them reduce their energy costs and save money while also safeguarding their health and safety.  </p> <p>     The program is free to those that qualify and state of Iowa community action agencies administer the program. This means that if you qualify for the program, you will not have to pay for it.   Contractor crews that are highly trained install measures that are permanent and cost-effective, such as offering energy education, doing insulation work, repairing or replacing furnaces (non-emergency), reducing air leaks, and doing complete energy audits that are free of charge.  </p> <p>     To contact Alliant Energy, call 1-800-255-4268.

The amount of cash grants and assistance offered will be based on the number of persons in the household, the type of fuel they use (e.g. propane, electric, etc.), as well as the applicant's total household income.   There are several important factors to consider.  </p> <p>     For more information on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), please contact your local community action agency, Ameren, or 866.674.6327.  </p> <p>    The money that is raised from donations will go to help Ameren Illinois customers who are struggling.

American Express debt management plans.," <p>     If you have an American Express credit card, you can enroll in their Call to Action debt management plan to help you pay off your debt. If a customer does not qualify for that option, then other assistance may be provided.   Many companies are now offering new plans.  </p> <p>     The credit card company offers its customers low or zero percent interest rates on their account, as well as other support.   The DMPs are made available to individuals who meet the required qualifications based on various conditions.   The plan being offered by American Express also helps people save money each month, with savings ranging from $25 to $200.   The savings plan is intended to help families by ensuring they have enough money saved up to cover emergencies or other unexpected expenses.  </p> <p>     In addition, American Express is planning on getting rid of late fees and also over limit fees as part of the Call to Action Plan. For example, some companies may also offer budgeting assistance and educational resources to help you better understand and manage your finances.   They will also lower consumers' APR so that the DMPs will not have repayment terms of longer than 60 months.  </p> <p>     The new DMPs can help you by providing you with a clear and concise plan that outlines your goals and how you can achieve them. Additionally, the DMPs can help you by providing guidance on how to best use your data to improve your marketing efforts and make smarter decisions.   If you owe American Express $10,000 on your credit card bills, your monthly payment to them will be about $200 in the regular Call to Action DMP and $175 in the hardship plan that is also now being offered.   You will owe significantly less money than the average cardholder.  </p><h2>Details of the American Express debt management plan (DMP)</h2> <p>     A DMP is a program designed to help people get the assistance they need quickly and easily.   The end result of the program is that it will help reduce their debt.   Most plans try to have consumers pay off their debts within 5 years at the longest.  </p> <p>     The credit card borrower will work closely with American Express or a credit counseling agency, and the agency will help the borrower understand and manage their credit card debt.   The company provides free services to help customers with their finances and budgeting. They will also assist with setting up monthly payments.  </p> <p>     The new American Express DMP not only helps borrowers get out of debt, but also helps them save money for a financial emergency. This meant that if a family wanted to go on vacation or make a large purchase they would have to put it on a credit card, increasing their debt.Today, there are debt management plans available that do not require families to put every spare dollar towards their credit card bills. This means that families are able to go on vacation or make large purchases without putting them on a credit card, and therefore not increasing their debt. What this means is that things are different now and this is not how it used to be.   The new Call to Action plans allow people to save money to use in case of an unexpected emergency.  </p><h2>What is a hardship customer?</h2> <p>    The cardholder would be allowed to request a hardship withdrawal from their account.  A hardship cardholder is someone who has experienced a financial emergency or some other type of especially challenging circumstance. The cardholder would be allowed to request a hardship withdrawal from their account.   The people who would owe the minimum 1.75% repayment rate on their debts would fall into this category.   That is a very low price.   Consumers who do not fall into the category of owing $5000 or more would still have a low monthly minimum repayment rate offered to them of 2 percent of their unpaid balance.   This DMP has a much higher repayment rate than other DMPs on the market.   This means that the savings are large.  </p> <p>   This means that a person who is struggling to pay off their credit card debt would only have to pay $525 per month, instead of a higher amount.   This program is significantly cheaper than past programs offered by American Express, which could cost up to $900 per month.   The repayment rate is much lower, which means the consumer saves a lot of money.  </p><h2>Other types of AmEx assistance programs</h2> <p>     The company also has programs that can help people who are struggling to pay off their debts.   In most cases, using an alternative payment plan offered by AmEx will lower your monthly payments by 10-25%. In some cases, AmEx can lower your payments by up to 40%.   Other forms of assistance may also be provided as part of these DMP plans or hardship cases. This could include cancelling or eliminating fees and late charges.  </p> <p>     Saying ""hardship programs"" instead of ""debt management plans"" changes the focus of the sentence from a product offered by American Express to a service offered by American Express. This may be more accurate, as American Express may not necessarily profit from customers in hardship programs.  </p>"
Help with credit card debt and bills from American Express.," <p>     American Express is helping consumers with credit card debt and creating budgets.   The company is helping consumers in many different ways.   If you are struggling to make credit card payments, they have a hardship program to help you. They also have a spending limit program to help you manage your budget.  </p> <p>     The new service from American Express allows cardholders to set maximum spending limits on additional credit cards that are opened on their account.   If another family member needs a credit card, this could be a useful option.  </p> <p>     The reason for this new service is to provide a easy and convenient way for customers.   Many people want more control over their spending to help them stay on budget, and American Express has the ability to provide this.  </p> <p>     The new program will allow parents to help their kids build a credit history, and to teach them how to use credit responsibly by using the caps that are in place.   By using a credit card at an early age, teenagers and young adults can build and maintain a solid credit history. Additionally, they can accumulate a detailed and lengthy history that will reflect their responsible credit usage.   One downside to this feature is that if the person is too young or immature, they may not use the card responsibly, but the maximum spending limit will help contain any damages.  </p> <p>     This new Amex tool will also allow the primary cardholder to change the maximum spending limit at any time, as well as set up a notification system to receive text messages or alerts when the spending limit has been reached on the card.  </p> <p>     There are many benefits to using additional cards with this feature, such as the ability to earn reward points faster or to build up a credit history in less time.   Consumers need to be mindful of not letting credit card debt grow to the point where it becomes difficult to repay.   If you have problems with your credit card, there are programs that can help you get out of debt.  </p><h2>American Express Credit Card Hardship Program</h2> <p>   This program is designed to help people who are struggling to make their payments. It provides them with options to make smaller payments or to skip payments altogether.   If you're experiencing difficulty paying your credit card debt or bills on time, you can call 1-800-678-0738 for help.  </p> <p>     To get more information on American Express' credit card hardship program, reach out to their customer service team. This program can help you get out of debt.   This means that sometimes they will allow you to not have to pay interest for a certain amount of time, and then they will lower the amount of interest you have to pay after that time period is up.   American Express hardship programs are designed to help customers who are experiencing financial difficulties. There are a number of different programs available, and customers can save money by enrolling in one of these programs.  </p> <p>     In our opinion, the American Express hardship program can provide customers with lower interest rates and monthly payments.   They are also not charging customers for late fees and other miscellaneous charges.  </p>"

Appeal assessment to save on property tax bills.," <p>     More homeowners than ever are protesting their property tax bills and asking for their home assessments to be reconsidered.   It does not cost anything to do, and the only thing you need to invest is your time to do some research.   Many people are successful in appealing their property taxes, with some local municipalities reporting a success rate of 40%. The City of Chicago reports that 50% of appeals are successful.  </p> <p>     More and more people are challenging their property taxes, from homeowners to businesses, all across the country.   People with different levels of wealth are taking action.   Families that are considering this step live in areas with high taxes, like Los Angeles and New York City, or in the Midwest, Florida, Arizona, and California.   People all over the country are appealing their property taxes and winning.  </p><h2>How many homes are overassessed?</h2> <p>     This means that people are paying more money than they should be for their property taxes.    too many homeowners are paying more taxes than they should. This is based on an estimation by National Taxpayers Union.   This means that if some homeowners win their appeals for lower property taxes, everyone else in the community will have to pay more in taxes to make up for the reduction.   If other homes appeal their assessments and you don't, you will be at a disadvantage.  </p> <p>     In some counties, property taxes are being raised to make up for lost revenue from people challenging their assessments.  </p> <p>     Homeowners are asking for new assessments of their property value, which is causing revenue losses for municipalities.   Even if your local government raises the rate of your home, you can still argue the worth of your home.  </p><h2>Formula to appeal property taxes</h2> <p>     There isn't a specific way to calculate property taxes.   The process of obtaining a building permit varies widely from one town or county to the next, even within the same state.  The amount of property tax someone owes is determined by a complex system of local government agencies, including cities, towns, school districts, and counties, each with its own set of rules.   This means that a decrease in your home's assessed value does not necessarily mean a decrease in your property taxes.  </p> <p>     Government officials and assessors say that the number of home appeals and property tax challenges has increased over the years.   The number of appeals keeps increasing, and there seems to be no letdown in them.  </p><h2>Examples of homeowners appealing real estate property taxes</h2> <p>     In suburban Atlanta, people have gone to their local government offices to file their requests for property value reassessments before a March 31 deadline.   The number of people appealing or challenging their property taxes in Ohio has increased five times.   The demand for tax lawyers and assessors has increased in the northern suburbs of New York, causing some cities and towns to hire extra employees.  </p> <p>     The number of appeals is increasing in New Jersey, which has the nation's highest property tax values. This is causing problems for the state as it is almost overwhelmed by tax appeals.   The homeowner's house is assessed at $1.8 million, but it cannot be sold and is sitting on the real estate market with an asking price of $1.3 million.   She is the perfect person to appeal her home value.   She can reduce her tax liability to 1.3 million.  </p> <p>     A homeowner in California, including Los Angeles, is challenging the assessed value of her home.   Her two-bedroom home is located in a community for older residents and was assessed for as much as $580,000 three years ago.   The prices of houses on her block have decreased significantly, so her home is now worth much less than it was previously.  </p> <p>     Due to the large number of property tax appeals, local assessors and property appraisers are very busy.   Many experts believe that most people will see a significant decrease in their taxes if they simply request it.  </p> <p>     The tax rates for cities and counties are always changing.   This means that the county has lowered the value of over 130,000 properties in Contra Costa California. This is due to new assessments and valuations that have been put into place. The main point is that you shouldn't hesitate to appeal your property taxes.   Many other homeowners across the nation are choosing to save money by taking advantage of solar energy.  </p>"

Make sure the payment you agree to is one you can afford to pay on your account.  </p> <p>     Most hospitals will allow you to set up a payment plan for your medical bills, but there is usually a time limit for how long you have to pay them off before the debt is sent to a collections agency.

Cash assistance from the TANF benefit program.," <p>    The federal government created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to help low income and needy families with children.

To find out if you are eligible for TANF benefits and how to apply, please see the information below.  </p> <p>     The goal of this program is to help families with basic needs like food and shelter.   Examples of things that can be paid for with assistance are: housing, rent, energy bills, food, and health care needs such as medications.  </p> <p>     It is important that the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program helps individuals gain longer term self sufficiency.   Most social service agencies that run TANF programs will also help people find a job, attend training classes, and improve their overall employment skills.   Each state has different requirements for how to apply for TANF benefits. You can find more information on how to apply at each state below, including the online TANF applications process.  </p> <p>     TANF will only provide financial assistance to those who are actively seeking employment or enrolled in some form of educational program.   If someone receiving government benefits doesn't find a job within two years, their benefits will be cut off.

The government has established that participants need to be actively looking for work and take responsibility for their own hardships.   If they meet other eligibility criteria, people can get help paying for all sorts of expenses, like food, clothing, and commuting costs.   The program provides temporary cash assistance for low-income families, with time limits in place.   Welfare typically lasts for no more than 60 months.  </p> <p>     Other benefits that states offer to clients include:  -Protection from creditors -Exemption from taxes -Access to government benefits -Permanent residency   This will include financial aid and social services alongside TANF.

This will help the family become more financially stable and independent.  </p><h2>Amount of cash assistance from TANF</h2> <p>     The amount of money you get from the government for being low income and/or having a lot of kids varies depending on what state you live in.   The average amount a family spends on utilities per month is around $100, but this number can differ depending on the size and needs of the family.   Some states will also look at the monthly rental expenses when determining how much money the family needs.   Even though TANF benefits might not be a lot, usually just a few hundred dollars per month, additional funds might be given depending on how many people are in the household.   A social service office will often have a calculator to determine the amount of cash paid out from TANF grants.  </p> <p>     The program has a set amount of time it will run for.   Families that receive cash assistance from TANF will need to meet work participation requirements, or the assistance will end.

Are Triple Pane Windows Worth the Extra Cost?," <p>     If you are looking to buy new windows, you may be wondering if triple-pane windows are worth the cost.   They are more expensive to buy and install, but they save you money on your utility bills, improve your quality of life, and offer other benefits.  </p> <p>     Is it worth it to spend more money on Triple Pane Windows, especially if you have to replace multiple windows in your house?   The main advantage of triple-pane windows is that they are much more effective at insulating your home than double-pane windows. This means that they will keep your home warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer, which will lead to lower utility bills. In addition, triple-pane windows will also reduce the amount of noise that comes into your home, making it a more peaceful and relaxing environment.   They also help improve quality of life by reducing outside noise.  </p><h2>What Are Triple Pane Windows?</h2> <p>     A window is a single pane of glass that is used to protect your home from the outdoors.   Windows have multiple panes because each pane adds an extra layer of protection.   Each window segment is closed tightly and most are filled with either argon or krypton gases. These gases help to prevent heat from entering or leaving the home.   They help save money on energy bills and prevent exterior noise.  </p> <p>     New window technology has made it easier to keep heat inside homes and businesses during the winter.   Typically, for those who have just bought a home, new windows are one of the first things on their to-do list. This is because old windows can make a house feel uncomfortable, and new windows can change that.  </p> <p>     All windows are coated with low-emissivity films, which are plastic films that contain metal or metal oxide.   The low-E film is a thin layer of material that is applied to the surface of glass. This film reflects solar heat in the summer and conserves interior heat in the winter.  </p> <p>     Both triple-pane and double-pane windows have sealed units consisting of panes of glass containing a gas that prevents heat transfer.   Triple-pane windows have an additional sealed unit.   An extra layer of insulation can make your home much warmer.  </p><h2>How Do Triple Pane and Double Pane Windows Differ?</h2> <p>     Adding an extra layer of glass to windows helps to keep heat out in the summer and heat in during the winter.   This means that your utility bills will be lower because you will be losing less heat and preventing solar heating in the summer.  </p> <p>     This means that triple-pane windows are better at resisting heat flow than other types of windows.   This means that double pane windows provide better insulation than triple pane windows.   The R value is a measure of how well a material can insulate. The higher the R value, the better the insulation. In this example, a window with an R value of 3 is 35% less efficient at insulating than a window with an R value of 5.   Triple pane windows are more efficient at blocking heat loss than double pane windows by 50%.  </p> <p>    To reduce condensation on windows, you can take a few measures. One is to improve the indoor air quality by ensuring proper ventilation in the home. Another is to increase the surface temperature of the window by adding window film or insulated curtains.  Condensation on windows is a sign of heat loss and can be improved by adding insulation or window film to increase the surface temperature. Proper ventilation in the home will also help to improve indoor air quality and reduce condensation.   If your windows are not performing well, it will cause your HVAC system to work harder and use more energy, resulting in higher utility bills.   The warm air from inside your home comes into contact with the cold glass of the window, and this causes water to form in droplets on the window.   Triple-pane windows are less likely to cause condensation on the glass because they reduce heat transfer.   Triple-pane glass helps to prevent condensation, and also helps to keep moisture and humidity inside your home.   This is useful for cold, dry winters.  </p> <p>    Gas between the panes of glass also helps to reduce unwanted noise from outside your home. By investing in new windows, you can not only reduce your carbon footprint, but also make your home a more peaceful place to live.  Windows with three panes of glass create a tighter seal around your house, keeping out exterior air. The gas between the panes of glass also helps to reduce noise from outside your home. New windows can help reduce your carbon footprint and make your home a more peaceful place to live.   A well-insulated home will not only keep your home warm and lower your utility bills, but it will also be more soundproof.   Triple pane windows are much better at reducing noise than single pane windows. They can significantly reduce noise pollution from things like screeching tires, honking horns, and your noisy neighbors.   Triple-pane windows make a home more comfortable because they have the extra sealed unit.  </p> <p>     If you want to save energy in your home, buy windows that are rated by Energy Star.   The additional cost of energy-efficient windows is offset by the savings on utility bills over time.   The windows have a low-E film coating, a layer of foam in the interior frame, and argon or krypton gas between the panes, which can improve the performance of double pane windows.  </p> <p>     The thickness of the glass panes also affects their energy efficiency.   The most energy efficient windows are those that are 1 1/4"" to 1 3/8"" thick. Many manufacturers offer windows that are only 7/8"" thick.   When buying windows for your home, check each one individually. Count the number of panes and examine the films on them. Make sure the space inside the sealed unit is filled with gas, and pay attention to the thickness of the pane.  </p><h2>Are Triple Pane Windows Worth the Additional Up-Front Cost?</h2> <p>     I believe that the cost is worth it for these items.   Triple pane windows are more effective than double-pane windows at reducing heating costs, letting in less condensation, and blocking out noise.   Triple-pane windows are better at keeping heat in, which saves you money on your energy bills.    Triple-pane windows will be more expensive to install, but they will be better insulated and will save money in the long run.  </p> <p>     Windows with three panes of glass, when installed by a professional, can help a household save money on their energy bill each year.   This means that triple-pane windows could save you up to $75 a year on your energy bills if you spend $1500 a year on your utility bills.   If you are a low income family and cannot afford to pay for energy improvements, you can apply for weatherization assistance.  </p> <p>     This means that triple-pane windows may cost more to install in your home.   Triple pane windows are more difficult to install because they are heavier.   You should be thinking about the installation costs as you get quotes from different installers in your area.   Make sure you calculate the extra installation costs and compare prices to get the best deal.  </p> <p>     Triple pane windows are more expensive than double pane windows, but they save homeowners more money in the long term.   Once you have paid the product and installation fees, you will save money on your energy bill by purchasing triple-pane windows. Your house will also be more comfortable to live in.   The price of triple-pane windows is dropping and getting closer to the price of double-pane windows.  </p> <p>     As more manufacturers produce triple-pane windows, the price of them will go down. If you're worried about the high price of triple-pane windows, remember that you'll save money in the long run.  </p>"

Information on Arizona Hardest Hit Fund.," <p>     The federal government will be giving the state of Arizona over $120 million as part of the hardest hit fund.  Thousands of families across the state are expected to be able to receive foreclosure and mortgage help.   This funding will be used to help homeowners through a variety of means, such as paying for permanent mortgage modifications, providing advocacy through HUD counselors, paying the mortgage for the unemployed, settling second home loans, and offering temporary and short-term mortgage assistance and grants.  </p> <p>     The money will mostly be used to help people who owe more money than their property is worth.   To receive a principal reduction from the Arizona Department of Housing, the mortgage principal must be greater than 120% of the present market value of the home. The borrower can receive a $50,000 contribution from the bank or lender if they qualify. This contribution is to be used for principal reduction and will be matched by the bank or lender. The amount of money that the homeowner owes will be forgiven over a period of time.  </p> <p>     Other components of the Arizona Hardest Hit Fund include subsidizing monthly mortgage payments for unemployed or underemployed borrowers, extinguishing second mortgages on borrowers homes, and providing housing counselors so that free foreclosure assistance and advice can be offered.  </p><h2>Principal reduction from Arizona Hardest Hit Fund</h2> <p>   Arizona will be using over $90 million to help homeowners who owe more on their mortgage than their house is currently worth. This will either be in the form of reducing the principal balance or by forgiving a portion of the loan.   Several thousand homeowners are expected to benefit from this part of the program.   The main goal of the reductions is to help those who didn't make risky decisions and who are struggling due to bad luck or timing on their home purchase.   This program is not likely to be of much benefit to you if you have taken out a second mortgage, spent lavishly, and have high levels of debt.   Arizona is also giving several million dollars to help people pay off a second mortgage, if the second home loan was taken out for a valid reason.  </p><h3>





 



 </h3><h2>Unemployed mortgage assistance</h2> <p>     The program also helps people who have lost their jobs or had a decrease in income due to something out of their control.   This money will help people who are struggling to pay their mortgage because they are unemployed or facing a financial hardship.   Even if someone works fewer hours, they may still qualify for residency.   The borrower may be able to get help from the government to pay their mortgage for up to two years.  </p><h2>How do I apply</h2> <p>     The Arizona Department of Housing has put together a set of standards and guidelines to help make sure that the agency only helps those homeowners who have shown they are responsible in their home buying decisions.   This does not help those who live and spend money foolishly.   Contact your bank or lender, or the Arizona Department of Housing, and inquire about eligibility for the Arizona Hardest Hit Fund.  </p> <p>     A homeowner must be in danger of losing their home through foreclosure to be eligible for assistance. Other options and resources must have been pursued by the borrower as well   The Arizona Hardest Hit Fund can only be used for loans on a borrower's primary residence.   Other requirements for getting a loan modification include having a financial hardship, like losing your job, having a medical condition, or going through a divorce.  </p> <p>   If you qualify for the hardest hit fund, the money will go towards a homeowners permanent loan modification program.   The guidelines will be similar to the federal government’s program that makes home affordable modifications.   This means that more money will be used to pay off a second mortgage, as well as to help those who are unemployed or underemployed.  </p>"

Cash assistance programs in Arkansas.," <p>     To receive cash aid in Arkansas, applicants must submit a completed Cash Aid Application form, as well as any required supporting documentation, to their local county office.   The Department of Workforce Services in Arkansas is responsible for administering the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.   The state's version of the cash assistance program is commonly called TANF. The official federal government name for this welfare benefit is cash assistance, but it is called different names in Arkansas.  </p> <p>     The resources can be referred to as Temporary Employment Assistance that helps with post-employment expenses.  DWS operates the cash aid application at the state level, but local Division of County Operations offices accept the application information.  </p> <p>     The programs offered by the state of Arkansas provide financial assistance to families with very low incomes that have children, as well as single mothers and fathers.   The fund can be used to cover various costs such as housing, food, medical bills, transportation, clothing, and work-related expenses.   This means that TANF can be used to pay for almost any bill that a household might have, as long as it is something that is necessary.  </p><h2>Terms and types of cash assistance in Arkansas</h2> <p>     The state of Arkansas provides financial help to very low income households with children, provided they agree to a Personal Responsibility Agreement.   To be eligible for the program, applicants must meet certain requirements such as having a low income and owning few assets. Additionally, the child must be enrolled in school.   Only US citizens, national, legal aliens or permanent residents of the country/state are eligible for government grants from welfare.   A case manager can help provide more information about the program and help a family apply. They can also provide information on the average payment amount to expect each month.  </p> <p>     Additionally, the parent must also be employed, in job training, or taking some other measure to achieve long term stability.   Budgeting workshops and/or parent classes may also be needed.   The cash beneficiary must become independent and not rely on government assistance.  </p> <p>   The majority of people who receive Arkansas TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) are very low income. This means that they often have a difficult time paying bills and don't have the resources to become self-sufficient.   In these instances, the state will provide additional financial assistance, including section 8 vouchers, food stamps, and more.  </p> <p>     The Transitional Employment Assistance Program will provide assistance with transportation (free bus passes or gasoline vouchers), child care (including free day care vouchers), professional work clothes, job preparedness classes, and more.  We will do whatever is necessary to help the person receiving Temporary Employment Assistance to improve their situation.  </p> <p>     Assistance in the form of cash is only available for a limited amount of time.   This means that the recipient will have the product for a maximum of 2-5 years.   The average monthly payment is $200 to $250.   The amount of financial assistance a family can receive is based on their income, family size, assets, and the ages of their children.  </p> <p>     Arkansas also offers a TANF-type welfare program.   The idea behind Work Pays is that people who are willing to work hard will be rewarded with opportunities to improve their lives. This could include getting a better job, earning more money, or even becoming self-sufficient. Work Pays is a way to motivate people to take control of their lives and make something of themselves.   This cash assistance is available for people who “graduate” from TEA, and it helps them after they are working.   The Division of County Operations can provide a few hundred dollars per month on average to help with expenses.   The money can help pay for different types of expenses, like rent, utilities, medical bills, food, or something else.   It makes the transition to work much easier.  </p><h2>Contact information for cash assistance in Arkansas</h2> <p>     The Arkansas Cash Benefit information number is a government aid program that provides more information on this cash benefit.

Disability benefit programs in Arkansas.," <p>     There are several organizations in Arkansas that can help people with disabilities.   Case managers will help people to find a job, deal with difficult periods, and become more stable.   There are various forms of financial assistance available from the government, including grants, financial aid for bills, and emergency aid.   We provide long-term services as well.   The disabled can also receive financial and medical assistance from government benefits and non-profits.  </p> <p>     There are a lot of different programs you can choose from. The state of Arkansas will help disabled adults and children, as well as their families and caretakers.   If someone needs help, sometimes there are organizations that can give them assistance directly. Other times, people may be referred to government programs that can help them.   The Division of Developmental Disabilities Services is not the only organization that provides resources for individuals with developmental disabilities. There are other organizations and departments that individuals can contact for help.  </p><h2>Financial help for the disabled in Arkansas</h2> <p>     The Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Aging and Adult Services also provides programs and services for people with disabilities.

The following are examples of what is available.  </p> <p>     Adult Protective Services is a government agency that protects adults who are unable to protect themselves from abuse, neglect, or exploitation.   Sometimes people lack proper treatment or abuse people on purpose, but sometimes it happens by accident.

The Arkansas AAPD program is a Medicaid Waiver that provides home and community based services to people with physical disabilities who are at risk for nursing home placement.   It helps adults with physical disabilities by giving them community-based and home services.   The goal is to help the person live in their current environment, rather than in a nursing home or institution.  </p> <p>   This means that the Human Services Division will help people with disabilities find jobs.   Specialists can help you understand what job training, programs and services are available to you, and how working will affect your disability benefits.  </p> <p>   The state of Arkansas' Money Follows the Person program helps transition individuals who have resided in institutions into home and/or community-based programs that are approved and qualified by the state.   Some of the main beneficiaries are people with developmental disabilities and/or mental retardation.   The benefits are also for residents with mental illness and individuals that range in age from 19 to 64 with physical disabilities. This means that the program is not just for senior citizens or for people with certain chronic conditions. It is for anyone who needs help paying for health care.  </p> <p>       This program provides adaptive equipment to help with both daily living and employment.   The state can provide equipment and modifications to the living environment that make it easier to move around and do things independently.  </p> <p>     The Department of Human Services Division of Aging and Adult Services Attendant Care program provides assistance with activities of daily living.   This will depend on how much medicine you need and if your doctor approves of it.   If the client is found to be qualified, they may receive up to 8 hours of attendant care services per day, 7 days a week.  </p> <p>     If the program has funding available, there are two main types of attendant care that can be arranged.   The first option is an agency attendant care. With this option, clients choose an agency to provide care for them.   This means that the individual chooses their own carers, and is in charge of directing their care.   The client or their caregiver will be responsible for finding, hiring, and supervising attendants, as well as approving payment.   In some cases, the individual selected may be a family member, but their spouse cannot be selected.  </p> <p>    This project began in 1995 and gives eligible food stamp recipients a chance to choose from a variety of food items.  The Independent Choices project in Arkansas is a program that provides food stamp recipients with a selection of food items to choose from. This project began in 1995 and is still running today.   It will allow people to get care at home by giving them a monthly allowance instead of Personal Care Services.  </p> <p>     The Department of Human Services can provide information on federal government financial aid and state benefits.   The assistance is mostly for disabled residents who have low incomes.   Both immediate needs and long-term goals can be met so that clients can become self-sufficient.  </p> <p>     The LIHEAP Home Energy Assistance Program is a financial assistance program for paying utility bills. A crisis program is also offered through LIHEAP when faced with a disconnection.   Disabled individuals can receive food assistance through the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) food stamp program.   Other benefits that are available for people living in Arkansas include access to health care and medications through Medicaid, low income housing, and job training.   There are many programs in Arkansas that can help low-income people with their utility bills.  </p> <p>     The Division of Adult Services provides counseling and case management services to disabled adults.      Clients will learn how to manage, recruit, interview, hire, evaluate, supervise, or even fire attendants.   Counseling Support Managers can help connect clients with other benefits they may be eligible for, such as food stamps, cash aid, and medical care.  </p> <p>     In general, people on disability in Arkansas have a low-income as the amount they receive from SSI or SSDI is not high.   Public assistance programs can help people with basic needs like food.   There are other resources both private and non-profit.   There are many resources available to help low-income families get the food and medical care they need. Free or reduced-price meals, home delivered food, and affordable medical care are just a few of the options available.   There are food stamp applications near you that you can continue with.  </p> <p>     For more information on any of these programs, call the Department of Human Services Division of Aging and Adult Services at (800) 478-9996.  </p><h2>Arkansas benefits, equipment, medial care and other disability services</h2> <p>     The Division of Developmental Disabilities Services is responsible for allocating resources to adults and children with developmental disabilities.

There are a few different types of care available, as well as some health services that can be arranged.  </p> <p>    The organization also oversees the program for children with special health care needs who are Title V. This is a government benefit that helps children with chronic medical conditions. It is available in Arkansas.     The child must be determined to be medically eligible and the family's income must meet certain low income levels in order to be considered financially eligible.  </p> <p>   If the family does not have enough money to pay for medical bills, the Title V program may be able to help by paying for some or all of the costs. This assistance is only available if funding is available.   This means that if a child is covered by private insurance, the health care provider must bill the insurance company first before billing Title V for payment.   The payment providers and doctors receive from the state of Arkansas for Title V must be accepted.

Arkansas Lifeline program and assistance paying telephone bills.," <p>     Low income families in Arkansas can receive a discount on their telephone bills or even a new, free cell phone from government-sponsored programs.   The Public Service Commission works with the Federal Communications Commission on Lifeline, which helps households save money each month.   Link-Up is a program that offers a discount of up to 50% on the set up of a new account.  </p> <p>     The goal is to make sure all homes in the state can always communicate during an emergency.   The goal of this assistance is to stop people from disconnecting their phone service if they can't pay their bill.   This program will make it possible for every family to be able to afford a mobile or home phone, which will give them access to local resources.  </p> <p>     The assistance programs are especially important for families who have a low and fixed income.   Many people in Arkansas who are seniors or have a disability rely on the Lifeline discount to keep their telephone service active.   The government wants to help people in need, so they have created a program to help pay for people's cellular phone bills.   The program is not just for the most vulnerable people, it is for anyone who meets the income targets.  </p> <p>     Phone companies are required to offer this assistance to their customers in Arkansas.   The companies that provide telecommunications services are the ones that process applications and sign up consumers.   The state agency regulating the Public Service Commission in Arkansas ensures that all terms and conditions set by the Commission are being followed.  </p> <p>     Some telephone companies offer a service called Lifeline which provides discounted rates for phone service.   This government program provides free cell phones to new customers in Arkansas from companies such as Safelink Wireless.   Assurance is a company that provides similar services to what is being discussed.  </p> <p>     There are other providers as well.   The main cell phone companies, such as AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint, all participate in this program.   They will offer discounts on their services to people who meet the criteria for Lifeline and follow all state regulations.   No matter which company someone deals with, they will be able to save money.  </p> <p>     The telephone service discount is only for local, basic service.   This doesn't include long distance costs or some additional features that some households may want.   Before joining the program, families should read the contract carefully.  </p><h2>Application process in Arkansas for phone bill programs</h2> <p>   In order to be eligible for assistance from the state of Arkansas, applicants must fall below a certain level of income.   This means that as the poverty level changes, so will the income required to be considered for assistance programs. However, in general, the government assistance programs require that a household's income is approximately 150% above the poverty level.   This means that the number of people who can live in a home will be affected by the cutoffs.   This means that households with more members are allowed to have a higher income.  </p> <p>     This means that if a family in Arkansas is receiving public assistance, they will also be automatically enrolled in Lifeline, which provides a discount on monthly phone service. This means that families who receive food stamps, LIHEAP energy bill assistance, SSI, or other benefits will be able to get a discount on their telephone bill.   They just need to request this from their phone company and show proof of the benefit.  </p> <p>     No more than one phone per home is permitted, regardless of how many people live in the house or apartment. This means that a family will need to choose between a home phone or a cell phone.   If you have more than one phone with Lifeline service, you will not receive a discount on your phone bills.  </p> <p>   For more information or to apply, contact your phone company directly.   If you think you have been unfairly denied access to Lifeline or the Link-Up program, you should contact the Arkansas Public Service Commission Consumer Services Division at (800) 482-1164.  </p>"

Arlington Housing Authority assistance programs.," <p>     The Arlington Housing Authority provides a variety of services to families and individuals in the county, with a focus on housing and homeless prevention.

Clients can choose from different types of housing, like single-family homes, condos, townhouses and apartments.  </p> <p>     Usually, people who participate in Section 8 have their housing subsidy paid directly to their landlord by the local Public Housing Authority.

Get help when food stamp cuts occur.," <p>   If your food stamps (SNAP) have been reduced or changed, there is still help available.   Some people may have their benefits completely cut off.   There are different steps people can take to reduce the negative impacts to their household if food stamp benefits are reduced.  </p> <p>   We will give people tips on how to survive on a reduced budget.   Many people in the United States rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to help feed their families.   If their benefits are cut at all, it will have a big effect.  </p> <p>     The U.S. Department of Agriculture may reduce funding to the states to more manageable levels, which can cause this issue.   As states receive less federal funding for food stamps, benefits are being reduced or eligibility requirements are changing.  </p> <p>   The cuts will often be for Americans age 18 to 49 who are able-bodied and can work.   This means that if their food stamp payments are reduced, these groups of people do not have to worry about it.   People who are in job training programs or who are mentally ill may not be impacted by the change.  </p> <p>     There are ways people can manage a budget when food stamps are reduced, as it is often just a matter of time before it happens.   The USDA and states are having a difficult time justifying these extra entitlements being paid out when considering the strong job market and constant cutbacks to government budgets.   Some things people can do if they are impacted by a lower food stamp payment being placed on an EBT card are the following:  -look for local food pantries or soup kitchens -reach out to family or friends for help -look for government assistance programs  </p><h2>Alternative steps to take when food stamps are cut</h2> <p>     If you are no longer qualified for any public aid programs, check with local charities and non-profits for assistance.   There are food pantries that help low income people.  </p> <p>     This means that if you visit a food pantry three times each month, you could receive up to $100 worth of free groceries for your family.   If a pantry can provide a few hundred dollars worth of food per month, it can make up for the SNAP benefits that some people lose.   I'm looking for a list of food banks and pantries in the United States.  </p> <p>     Shopping smartly and budgeting effectively can help you save money.   Families who use coupons and are mindful of sales and discounts can save 10-20% on their grocery bills.   That is not difficult to do.  </p> <p>     Many people use this tactic to save money on their grocery bills.   This is a lot of money, and being smart about shopping can help offset any reduction in SNAP food stamp benefits.  </p> <p>     There are many resources that offer affordable, healthy groceries. If you are trying to save money, you can still eat healthy.   Many people think that it is not possible to buy healthy and affordable food for their families when they lose their benefits.   This is false.  </p> <p>     If your family is one of the millions of people who have had a reduction in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance / SNAP benefit payments, or if the government has stopped making payments, you can still buy fresh fruits, vegetables, and more.   There are national delivery services that sell groceries at a discounted price for low income families. The discount can be up to 40% off.   You can save money on groceries by shopping smarter, finding cheaper but quality food, and cooking healthier meals.   When food stamp payments are reduced, this is an alternative. What are some ways to find cheap groceries?  </p> <p>     There may be other more extreme methods.   If you're receiving food stamps and your benefits are going to be reduced, it's important to find out as soon as possible. This way, you can make other arrangements for food for your family.   This provides time to make necessary changes.   There are some situations where people who have had a reduction in food stamps end up moving in with their parents or other friends/family.   Each week, thousands of people visit soup kitchens for a meal or two.   They are able to save money, which allows them to buy groceries for their family.   Other major lifestyle changes can be considered as well.  </p> <p>    You may or may not agree with the USDA policies on reducing food stamp benefits for families near the poverty level, but the fact is that government benefits such as food stamps and many others will continue to be reduced.   This means that many other homes will probably experience decreases.   Around 1 million Americans will be affected by cuts to their SNAP benefits in the next few years.  </p> <p>     The economy is stronger now than it was in the past, but the government still struggles to reduce budget deficits.   The government cannot justify spending the same amount of tax money on entitlement programs.   This means that your family will get less money to spend on food stamps.   eventually, everyone will be affected  </p>"

Get mortgage assistance from the California Hardest Hit Fund.," <p>     The Hardest Hit Fund is a program administered by the California Housing Finance Agency to help homeowners in the state who are struggling to make their mortgage payments.   The program will offer assistance to those struggling to make mortgage payments and prevent foreclosures. It was created with a budget of nearly $700 million dollars and will help tens of thousands of homeowners across the state.  </p> <p>     The hardest hit fund will be providing aid through four different programs.   The three ways to avoid or stop a foreclosure filing are to work with your lender, to file for bankruptcy, or to sell your home.   The fourth part of the program is designed to help people who owe more on their mortgage than the house is currently worth.   The type and amount of help that someone can receive is very broad.   If you are eligible for the program, you can receive up to $50,000 in benefits.   There are four main components to the program from which you can receive funding.   The four resources that are offered are books, articles, websites, and people.  </p><h2>California Mortgage Reinstatement Program</h2> <p>     This part of the hardest hit fund was created to provide immediate, direct financial assistance and cash grants to homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments.   The goal of the reinstatement option is to allow people to keep their homes and avoid foreclosures.   This program will provide millions of dollars in financial assistance to households, up to $15,000 per household or 50 percent of the past mortgage due arrearage amount.   This means that whatever dollar amount is contributed by the homeowners, the bank, mortgage servicer, insurer, borrower, or lender will also contribute that same amount.  </p><h2>California Hardest Hit Fund Unemployment Mortgage Assistance Program</h2> <p>     This part of the program is designed to help those who have lost their job or experienced a significant decrease in household income.   The Unemployment Mortgage Assistance Program provides temporary cash grants and other forms of financial assistance to help with mortgage payments.   Homeowners will receive varying amounts of money based on their personal situation, and the terms of the unemployment mortgage assistance will also differ based on the applicant.   These funds will help to pay a mortgage for up to six months.   The most you can get from this program is $1,500, or half of your monthly mortgage payment, whichever is less.   This means that the maximum amount of money that someone can receive from this assistance program is $9,000.  </p><h2>Principal Reduction Program</h2> <p>     If you owe more on your mortgage than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for the principal reduction program.   The government provides homeowners with cash, grants, and other forms of financial assistance from participating financial institutions and banks to reduce the outstanding principal balances of qualified borrowers who currently have a negative equity on their home.   This will lower the loan balance to a level that will help keep people in their homes and prevent foreclosures.   The program will give out funds up to $50,000 per qualified household.   This means that if you have $100 in your account, your lender will also have $100 in their account that they can use if you default on your loan.  </p><h2>Transition Assistance Program</h2> <p>     Lastly, if the homeowner has explored all options and programs, and if it is determined that there is no way for them to keep their home, the California Hardest Hit fund will provide them with transition  assistance to help them start over.

Help from Trade Adjustment Assistance program," <p>     The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps workers who have lost their jobs due to foreign trade, is being expanded as part of President Barack Obama's stimulus plan.   The program is expected to grow significantly over the next five years, providing more assistance to eligible Americans.  </p> <p>     There are a few things that could be improved.

The time frame the workers can get the unemployment checks is up to three years. This is almost twice as long as the typical worker who losses their job and who is not affected by ""off-shoring"", which is the shifting of American jobs to foreign countries.  </p> <p>     This means that from June 2009 onwards, workers who have been laid off will receive extra benefits.   The Trade Adjustment Assistance program will now provide more generous benefits to those who have lost their jobs in service industries such as software development, accounting, auto parts design and call center industries or operations.  </p> <p>     To be eligible for job training, participants must choose an occupation that is in high demand, such as a green job or a health care position.  </p> <p>    The trade assistance program provides training and benefits to around 50,000 workers across the nation.    According to Howard Rosen, who is the executive director of the Washington, D.C. based nonprofit TAA Coalition, which helps workers apply for and understand the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, said that this is what is happening.  </p>"
Financial and emergency assistance in rural communities.," <p>     It is ironic that many rural communities have had their economies devastated over the last few decades.   Many places have lost their main source of income, resulting in increased substance abuse and other problems.   There are programs to help rural communities, but they might not be as easy to find as programs for other areas.  </p> <p>     Transportation can be a problem because it can be difficult to get around.   This means that the person will need to spend a lot of time in their car.   The problem is that sometimes the person in crisis may not even have enough money for a tank of gasoline, or maybe they even lack transportation or their car broke.   If an elderly person in a rural area needs help but can no longer drive, sometimes it may be difficult for them to get the help they need.   There is a lack of public transportation options, such as buses or taxis.  </p> <p>     This means that people in rural areas may have difficulty getting to a charity or non-profit organization.   Families may need to ask someone to drive them to a center.   You can either ride a bike or walk.   This means that, in order to receive any kind of financial assistance from these organizations, you will likely have to complete an application in person, and may also need to participate in case management.  </p><h2>Examples of local rural agencies</h2> <p>     Community action agencies are organizations that can provide assistance to people in need, no matter where they live. These agencies can offer a variety of services, such as help with food or housing, and they can often connect people with other resources they may need. If you are struggling to make ends meet, reach out to your local community action agency to see what kind of help they can provide.   The federal government provides funding for these programs through CSBG grants.   Other organizations help with paying for resources. United Way and donation services are two examples.   Non-profit organizations that help fight poverty are considered important by many experts.  </p> <p>     There is a lot of variation in the services offered by different organizations, and it is rare to find two that offer exactly the same things.   Some of the services that may be offered in a rural area include programs to help with job training, applications for assistance with energy bills, Head Start programs, and resources from the USDA for food assistance.   They tend to offer referrals to people they know.   If you need help finding resources in your community, you can contact a community action agency. These agencies can usually provide you with information about where to find the help you need.  </p> <p>     The Salvation Army is an international organization that provides relief to those in need. It is typically ranked as the second largest charity organization.   There are over 7,000 centers of operations for this company in the United States, many of which are located in rural communities.   There are many places that offer financial aid for rent, food, or bills, such as senior housing centers, thrift shops, and family centers.   Over 20 million Americans receive some form of assistance from the government per year.   The Salvation Army provides social services to help people in need.  </p> <p>     In many parts of the country, there are also clinics in rural communities.   These groups focus on addressing both medical and dental issues.   Since many rural communities lack the adequate number of doctors, hospitals, or dentists, these clinics often step in to fill the need.  </p> <p>     The services that rural clinics offer can vary greatly from one to the next.   Some only offer physical or dental cleanings.  Even though some other places might provide better medical care that includes helping people recover from drug or alcohol abuse,   This means that they provide care based on how much money the person has, with the goal of helping low income families or the uninsured.   Search for medical clinics that offer care to patients within a specific community.  </p> <p>     Local churches often provide assistance to those who are struggling or in poverty. The studies conducted concludes that individuals living in rural areas are more religious than those residing in city regions. The results were based on the data collected from the participants about their religious affiliation and frequency of religious attendance.   So churches not only provide spiritual guidance, but they also try to help with things like food and supplies, and some even provide a little bit of money from time to time.   Each religious organization has different practices.   Church assistance programs can be a valuable resource for people in the church community who need help. These programs typically provide assistance to members of the local church community, but they can also be a source of help for people outside the community who need assistance.  </p><h2>National charities for rural communities</h2> <p>   There are also national charities that help support rural areas.   One advantage of these is that they can be done online or over the phone.   This means that people will not be able to go to a physical office to apply for the job.   This can help individuals who have problems with transportation.   There are many resources and programs available to help those in need.  </p> <p>     No matter where someone lives, they always have the government to rely on.   Each rural county will have a department that provides social services.   This is the place to apply for government benefits, including food stamps, low-income housing, USDA commodities, grants for paying bills, and other forms of public assistance.   The government makes it easy to apply for things online, which is helpful for people who live in rural areas.  </p> <p>     There are not as many employment opportunities and not as many people living in rural areas, so there are not as many banks and ""respectable"" lenders in these areas.   Even if there are public transportation options available, they are often not convenient to get to.   This can reduce the amount of credit available.   There are other lenders available in rural areas.  </p> <p>     It is never recommended to use a payday lender to borrow money.   Before you decide to get a bank loan, explore all other options first. This includes credit unions, online banking, peer-to-peer loans, and other alternatives.   There are many online lenders that can provide money to people in rural areas, even if they have poor credit scores. These options are often lower cost than traditional lenders.   There are many low cost options for payday loans. You can shop around and compare prices to find the best deal.  </p><h2>Jobs, career counseling and work programs in Rural America</h2> <p>     Working can be difficult sometimes.   Many industries have left rural towns.   Many businesses have either moved to cities or coastal communities, where costs are lower, or have gone overseas to take advantage of lower costs.   There are fewer jobs than people who need them, and some of those jobs may be too far away for many people to get to without a car.  </p> <p>     Working from home can be a good option for some people.   Sometimes employees can work for employers who are based in other countries.   This not only allows the person to get a job, but they do not need to worry about the costs of a car, gasoline, etc. This is a great way for someone to save money.   There are many work from home jobs available, but employers will only choose the most qualified applicants.  </p>"

Mortgage assistance from Associated Bank.," <p>     Associated Bank has created a new mortgage assistance program that will help unemployed mortgage customers continue to live in their homes. If you can't make your mortgage payments because you're unemployed, Associated Bank may be able to help by lowering or postponing your payments.   This means that the homeowners will not have to make a mortgage payment for up to one year.   This program is available only to customers whose mortgages are owned by Associated Bank. A large number of people who used this lender are eligible for the program.   Almost 30 percent of all homeowners who make their monthly mortgage payments to Associated Bank may be eligible for a mortgage assistance program that could help lower their monthly payments.  </p> <p>     A mortgage payment deferral is when you agree with your lender to postpone making mortgage payments for a set period of time.   This means that the homeowner can choose to delay their monthly payments, without accruing any additional interest. At the end of the loan, the entire unpaid balance, including any deferred payments, will be due. If the homeowners find new employment, Associated Bank will provide more options and assistance.   Other programs that may be available to help them could include further recalculating their remaining payments to include the amount of the mortgage that was deferred and also accumulated interest that may have happened over the remaining life of the loan. This would give the person a more accurate idea of how much they would need to pay in the future and could help them plan better.   The banks may decide to lower the interest rate on the mortgage or extend the length of the loan.  </p> <p>   Associated Bank has a strong relationship with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and services mortgages that have been sold to them. They each have their own mortgage mitigation rules and criteria.   If you need help, these programs can provide some assistance.  </p><h2>Terms of the unemployment mortgage assistance program</h2> <p>     This program is designed to help homeowners who are struggling and those who are not covered by the federal government's Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan.   To qualify for the program, the homeowner must have their first mortgage on their primary residence with Associated Bank. The homeowner must also be receiving unemployment benefits from the state and actively seeking employment.  </p> <p>     This program offers assistance to unemployed homeowners who are struggling to make their mortgage payments. The program provides temporary financial assistance to help make mortgage payments, and also offers long-term solutions to help make the mortgage more affordable.   This link provides more information on the topic. HAMP is a government program that helps homeowners who are struggling to make their mortgage payments. This program offers a way for these homeowners to modify their loans so that they can make lower, more affordable monthly payments. HAMP also provides financial assistance to these homeowners so that they can avoid foreclosure.  </p> <p>     Associated Bank may still decide to negotiate and/or modify the terms of the home mortgage even after borrowers have found new employment.   They will consider taking such actions as offering a refinancing, adjusting interest rates, or providing some form of other loan modification to help the borrower keep their home.   Phone the bank at 800-236-8866.  </p>"
Get assistance with upside down car loans.," <p>     This means that they would have to pay more money to the lender if they wanted to sell the car than what the car is actually worth.   There are a few programs that can help these individuals, with a focus on those applicants that need some form of transportation for work. These programs can help get them the transportation they need to maintain or find employment.   -Contact the lender and inquire about refinancing options -Look into government assistance programs -Consider selling the car  </p> <p>     Many families who work hard find themselves stuck with a car loan that has negative equity. Negative equity occurs when you owe more on your loan than your car is worth. This can happen if you put little money down when you got the loan, the car’s value drops, or you make payments slowly.   Many people are in this situation because of the poor financial decisions they made, such as buying a car they couldn't afford, not making a big enough down payment, or taking out a car loan for too many years.   Other people may need help because their financial situation changed since they made the purchase.   The borrower may have had a serious medical issue, their spouse may have died, or another exceptional circumstance may have occurred.  </p> <p>     The goal of any type of assistance is to help people who are in a difficult situation that they did not cause.   The following are examples of situations where a borrower who owes more on their loan than the home is worth can get assistance.   However, it should be noted that the assistance programs are very limited and the applicant often has to make difficult decisions. They also generally need the car for work reasons.  </p><h2>Resources to help borrowers with upside down car loans</h2> <p>     If someone is struggling with their finances, it is recommended that they contact a non-profit credit counseling agency to get started.   Some companies may be able to provide free help to low-income borrowers on car loans that are upside down, as well as provide advice on other consumer debts.   There are many of these organizations located throughout the United States.   Some companies only provide these services to one or more cities, while others provide them to the entire nation.  </p> <p>     If you're struggling to make payments on your upside down car loan, a credit counselor may be able to help. They can offer suggestions on how to get out of the loan and improve your financial situation.   The solution is not always easy, and most applicants may not be able to get help because their financial situation is so bad.   Some ways to save money each month may include consolidating all debts to free up income, taking on another part-time or side job, selling the car and then buying a much more affordable one, and more.   After looking at each situation, a decision is made based on what seems best for that particular case.   There are other ways to get debt help from non-profit credit counseling agencies.  </p> <p>     If the borrower is in danger of losing their car or truck, and as a result, their job, there may be help available from charities or government funded programs.   If borrowers need assistance, these groups will generally only help if their situation negatively impacts their ability to make a living.  </p> <p>     There are several different programs to choose from.   They have programs that help with financing for those who may have trouble getting approved for a loan elsewhere. The auto loans have low costs and are only available to a small number of applicants.   This program helps people who need a car for work or job training by paying for their transportation.   Other places to look for help with employment needs are community action agencies.  </p> <p>     Organizations such as churches, charities, and non-profits may be able to help borrowers who owe more on their car loan than the car is worth.   There are only a few agencies that can help with transportation.   There may be some costs that the applicant has to pay, but the interest rates for the automobile loan will often be lower than other rates.   What are the free automobile programs?  Where can I find information on free automobile programs?  </p> <p>     As a last resort, borrowers who are struggling to make payments on their auto loan can try contacting other lenders for help. Credit counselors may also be able to provide assistance.   There are many different ways to borrow money, including through peer-to-peer lenders, credit unions, salary advances, and payday lending companies.   There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these options, and usually if someone owes more on their car loan than the car is worth, they have other financial problems as well. So these options are not usually good alternatives.   Although they may not be the most reliable, they can still be taken into account.  </p> <p>     These loan products may be able to help in a small number of cases.   Some lenders focus on borrowers with poor credit scores, while others cater to a more mainstream audience.   There are 10 different products that are targeted at different types of consumers.   There are a number of loans available with low interest rates which could help to cover the cost of transport. This means that if a family owes money to a lender for their car, and the car is totaled, the insurance payout may be able to cover the difference.  </p>"
Associated Churches charity programs.," <p>     Associated Churches may be able to provide households in Allen County with assistance or referrals.   This non-profit provides financial support to people who are less fortunate. This support can come in various forms, depending on the need of the person.   There are many programs available to help those in need, including seniors, the disabled, unemployed, new parents, and others.   They partner with the state of Indiana Anti-Hunger Coalition to provide emergency food and housing assistance.  </p> <p>     The Emergency Food Program is a system that helps to connect local food pantries and soup kitchens so that people in need can get access to food.   Associated Churches is able to provide a household with a large assortment of free groceries, fruits, canned goods and other nutritious foods, depending on the resources available.   The pantry's clients may be able to receive up to twelve packages a year, depending on their household income.   Pantries in the Neighborhood Food Network have food available to make healthy meals, as recommended by the USDA and other experts.  </p> <p>     A Baby Closet is a place where newborns and low income families can go to get clothes and other necessities.   This organization also helps single mothers.   The Associated Churches of Fort Wayne and Allen County ministry can help you with getting a crib, free diapers, clothing, and referrals to places to get formula.   Other services may include advice on how to keep children's immunizations up-to-date or coupons for free goods.  </p> <p>     Seasonal and holiday support is also available.   There will be an annual Thanksgiving meal service for eligible clients, as well as help at Christmas, maybe even including a small present for a child. This meal service will help those who may not have a traditional Thanksgiving or Christmas.   The holiday packages usually include food that has been donated by the community, like turkeys and other things to go with them. They also usually include personal hygiene items and cleaning supplies. If money is not an issue, then the seasonal support could be eggs, meat, and produce to supplement the packages.  </p> <p>     This program is for students who get free school meals and need food for the weekends.   This program provides free, healthy snacks to low-income children who are at risk for hunger. These snacks help fill the hunger void by giving children healthy, easy to prepare foods.   Some churches in the area may offer free meals during the summer months. When it comes to the snacks, each enrolled student will be given a few sealed snack packs a few weekends a month or during a break, such as over the holidays.  </p> <p>     The community can get information on local food pantries, soup kitchens and other emergency providers not just in Allen County, but really anywhere across the state of Indiana.   The coalition's goal is to educate the community about what hunger really is and find solutions for low-income, poverty-stricken people.  </p> <p>     Transitional shelters are places where homeless people can stay until they find a more permanent home.   They will offer guests food, clothing, and a place to live or stay.   These various supportive services are intended to address the reason why someone is homeless, and assistance is for anyone who is temporarily without a place to live.  </p> <p>     This means that we always take initiative and never wait for someone else to do something first.   The Associated Churches ministry helps people in Fort Wayne and other cities who are at risk of becoming homeless. They work with individual clients, their landlords, and even entire families. Their goal is to prevent homelessness.   Other resources may be used as well, such as the Continuum of Care of local government human service departments.  </p> <p>     The program helps people who can't pay their rent or security deposit by working directly with their landlords.   If someone is struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments, they can get help from a HUD-approved counseling agency. These agencies provide free or low-cost counseling to help people keep their homes.   If you don't pay your utility bills, you may get evicted.   The goal of any service available is to help people keep their homes or to help them move to more affordable, safe housing.  </p> <p>     Case managers can help people apply for financial assistance from government grant programs or other local charities.   The charity pays the utility and heating oil companies, or the landlord, directly to prevent the client from becoming homeless.  </p> <p>     This means that when you get support from Associated Churches, they will also help you plan and achieve your goals in life.   Discussions with a social worker or volunteer case manager will need to take place on a weekly basis in order to assess needs and progress.   The Life Plan process will also involve many services that will take place on-site. These services include maintaining healthy relationships, being a good parent, managing money properly, repairing credit, and more.  </p> <p>     This service helps people in poverty by connecting them with resources and opportunities in their community. This will provide clients with the tools and advice they need to improve their situation, for example by getting a job or more education.  </p> <p>     There are other services that offer aid and support.   If someone needs a ride to a job interview, volunteers may give them a lift.   If you need clothing for school or work, then that is a possibility.   The Associated Churches of Fort Wayne and Allen County will help individuals regain stability by providing them with basic needs such as clothing or a ride to work.  </p> <p>     Associated Churches of Fort Wayne and Allen County is a group of many charities.

Prescription assistance from AstraZeneca.," <p>     AstraZeneca offers four main programs to help people who cannot afford to buy prescription medications on their own. The article is discussing people who are enrolled in Medicare Part D, people who don't have health insurance, and people who have had a financial emergency.   The Co-Pay Support service provides assistance with co-pays for Specialty Care Products. More information on this service is available below.  </p> <p>     The name of these patient assistance programs is AZ&Me. The largest discounts on prescription drugs will be given to those applicants with the lowest incomes. We want to help as many people as possible to afford their medication.  </p> <p>       Each program has conditions that applicants must meet; however, the service is free for those who qualify.   There are some basic requirements that need to be met in order to qualify for something. These requirements may change depending on the situation, but in general, these are the things that you will need.   There are certain conditions that must be met in order for a person to be eligible for this program. Some of those conditions include having a low income, being a single parent, or being a part of a minority group.  </p> <p>     To be eligible for this program, patients must have been prescribed an AstraZeneca medication from the list of covered drugs. The list of medications that are given for free or at a reduced rate is always changing.   This drug manufacturer only provides assistance for medications, and does not cover competitors.  </p> <p>     Patients must have a Green Card, Social Security number, or Work Visa to be seen at this clinic.   There is help available for both immigrants and United States citizens.  </p> <p>     Patient assistance programs help people who have gone through something difficult or life-changing.   This can often include events such as a loss or change in prescription drug insurance coverage, a substantial change in income, job loss or reduction in hours, change in the number of people in the household, or divorce or change in marital status.  </p> <p>     In all these cases, the person seeking help from AstraZeneca also needs to have a limited income; so they can't afford to pay for the medications on their own.   This needs to be backed up by financial documentation that will be requested when someone applies.  </p> <p>     If you meet the qualifications listed above, you can sign up for the free medication programs.   The program is only temporary and will last for only one year. After that, the client will need to reapply if they are still qualified.   If someone's financial situation changes in the next 12 months, they need to tell AstraZeneca. If the company discontinues the program, the patient may have to pay back any money already received.  </p> <p>     AstraZeneca provides a service called AZ&Me that offers several ways to obtain AstraZeneca medications.   The results of the tests can be sent to either the patient's home or the doctor's office.   This can be very helpful for older people who are on Medicare Part D.   This means that the person who is prescribing the medication can order more of it to be delivered to the person who needs it.  </p> <p>     The AstraZeneca Co-Pay Support for Specialty Care Products program is another option. This program assists with the cost of prescription medications for AstraZeneca patients with commercial insurance. The number to reach this company is 844-275-2360.   This service provides financial assistance to patients who are responsible for paying the co-pay portion of their medical bill for a prescription drug not covered by their current health insurance plan.   This means that while you will not be given free medication, you will still receive some form of assistance.  </p><h2>AstraZeneca that are covered from patient assistance programs</h2> <p>     The following is a list of services that AZ&Me can provide to low-income patients or families without health insurance.

Find how attorneys can provide debt settlement services.," <p>   If you are in debt and struggling to pay it off, you may want to consider hiring a debt settlement attorney.   They work with your creditors to lower the amount of money you owe them. This may include eliminating some of the debt altogether.   Costs for this service may depend on how much money the lawyer saves, or they may charge a one-time fee.   This means that the attorney will focus on debts that are not backed by collateral, such as credit cards, department store cards, and medical bills.  </p><h2>How does an debt settlement attorney differ from a credit counselor?</h2> <p>     Credit counseling agencies help you create a plan to pay back your debt over time. Debt settlement attorneys negotiate with your creditors to try to get them to agree to accept less than the full amount you owe.   The two groups also differ in the tactics, skill sets, and experience levels.   Debt settlement is a more aggressive way to get out of debt than credit counseling. If it is successful, it can get you out of debt in less time than credit counseling.    Lawyers will often have different, more aggressive skillsets that they can bring to the table to help their clients.  </p> <p>     While it may be risky and have a negative impact on your credit scores in the short term, over the long term the risk is lowered.   If you already have bad credit and are considering something drastic like filing for bankruptcy, then you don't have much to lose by trying to settle your debt.   When someone tries a new approach, using an attorney can be most beneficial.  </p> <p>     An attorney can help you settle your debts and avoid bankruptcy. An individual should consider this even if you are just thinking about bankruptcy.   Creditors may use aggressive collection tactics that infringe on your rights. In these cases, it may be best to take a legal approach.   If you are considering bankruptcy, you should consult with an attorney.   They can tell you what your legal rights are, help you get rid of your debt, and help you get back on your feet.  </p><h2>What to look for in an attorney?</h2> <p>   It is important to check the references of any debt settlement lawyer you are thinking of using to make sure they are reputable and can be trusted.   If you are unsure about using someone new to the industry, consider using someone with a good track record instead.   Make sure you get specific examples of how much money and what percentage of savings the person has saved others, as well as details and references.   What percentage of your cases are successful and what percentage are not?  </p> <p>     Make sure this information is true.   You should always check the Better Business Bureau for complaints against the business or firm.   You should try to find an attorney who knows a lot about money and financial issues, and who has experience dealing with different creditors.  </p><h2>How will debt settlement attorneys assist</h2> <p>     Debt negotiation attorneys help people negotiate with creditors to lower their payments or get rid of debt altogether.   They can make agreements with credit card companies, hospitals, medical providers, and others.   They can help you reduce the amount of debt you have and make your monthly payments more manageable.  </p> <p>     If the lawyer has experience with bankruptcies, they might suggest that option to you after looking at your situation. The lawyer you use from a debt settlement company will be more skilled in negotiating with creditors to reduce the amount you will need to pay in a lump sum settlement.   They will attempt to mediate a resolution.   What is the main thing that they work on or focus on?   Some companies will even offer programs to help you arbitrate your debt.  </p> <p>     After you enter into a contract with them, the lawyers will contact all of your current creditors.   They will contact any debt collection agencies to tell them to waive the late fees, penalties, and other expenses that are adding up on your accounts.   We will try our best to help you with any bills that are due.  </p> <p>     The attorney will negotiate with your creditors on your behalf so that collection agencies and credit card companies will contact the attorney instead of you.   This makes it easier for creditors to communicate with you in the future.   It also helps reduce the likelihood of having to go through aggressive collection practices.  </p> <p>     They also offer a service to review your credit report.   If something is incorrect, they will try to remove or fix it.   These experienced professionals can ensure that the consumer is being treated fairly. A lawyer may take legal action against the reporting agencies if necessary to resolve the issues.   They will also help improve your credit scores.  </p> <p>     It is important to remember your credit rating.   Make sure to have your debt settlement attorney negotiate for the removal of the deal from your report to minimize the impact to your credit scores when you settle with your creditors.   If the agreement is not recorded, the client will be able to borrow money from a bank or lender in the future.  </p> <p>     Credit repair is a service that helps people to improve their credit score.   We should never ignore it.   The customer should use this process to improve their credit rating.   The settlement company can also help you with understanding your expenses and creating a plan for future financial management to ensure you do not get into financial trouble in the future.  </p> <p>     Most creditors would rather work out a plan to pay off debt, such as negotiation, mediation, or debt settlement, than have the debtor declare bankruptcy.   The reason for this is that if you file for bankruptcy, the lender will usually not receive any money from you.   They would rather have some money rather than none.   Lawyers have a lot of knowledge about the law and they use this knowledge to help them in their work.  </p> <p>     Some creditors are willing to report settlements as ""paid as agreed"" on the consumer's credit record to encourage people to work with them.   An experienced attorney is the best person to represent you and negotiate with a bank or credit card company.  </p><h2>How much of my debt can they reduce? How much will they charge me?</h2> <p>     This answer is not specific. The time it takes to complete a task will depend on the individual and the task itself. Most debt settlement lawyers aim to reduce what you owe by 50 to 65%.   The fees they will charge you for their services are often based on how much money they save you.   This means that they will take a quarter of the money they save you.   This makes legal services more affordable and less risky for consumers.   Consultations for filing bankruptcy are available for free.  </p> <p>     This means that if the lawyer does not succeed in reducing your debt or saving you money, you do not have to pay them.   For example, if your debt is reduced by at least 30%, a debt settlement lawyer may not charge you for their services.   The service provided by the company will be at no cost to the client in terms of reducing debts.   This means that they will ensure that you will be successful to some degree.  </p> <p>     The attorney will try to reach an agreement with the other party for either a one-time payment or a payment plan, or a combination of the two.   If the client is unable to pay the creditors in one lump sum, then they can agree to pay monthly amounts over a set period of time, anywhere from 9 to 24 months. If you use a debt settlement lawyer or company, they will charge a fee which will be added to the amount you owe. This will be included in your monthly payment.  </p><h2>Can a debt settlement attorney provide mediation services?</h2> <p>    The author's position is that the death penalty is an ineffective form of punishment, and that it should be abolished. The author believes that the death penalty is not an effective form of punishment and should be abolished.   As part of the debt mediation process, the consumer will need to provide the lawyer / mediator with a document that gives the lawyer / mediator permission to act on the consumer's behalf.   After completing the debt management plan, the credit counseling agency will work with creditors to negotiate and settle specified debts, such as credit cards and medical bills, at reduced amounts. If you want to use a debt settlement mediator, you will probably have to stop using your credit card and pay the mediator a monthly fee.  </p> <p>    This is where you and your creditor(s) agree to use a third party to help you come to an agreement about your debt.  Debt mediation is when you and your creditor(s) agree to use a third party to help you come to an agreement about your debt. The snowball method is a way to pay off debt by paying the minimum payment on all debts except the one with the smallest balance. Once that debt is paid off, the payments are applied to the next smallest debt, and so on until all debts are paid.   This will also help reduce the amount of money you owe in interest, fees, and penalties.   This means that you would only have to pay back 60% of the total amount of debt that you owe.  </p>"

Augusta and Richmond County eviction help and rehousing assistance.," <p>     Non-profits and the city of Augusta are working together to stop homelessness.   The Emergency Solution Grant program and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides funding to prevent evictions and rapidly rehouse homeless families.  </p> <p>     This program involves several agencies in the community.   There are a few organizations that help with rent in Augusta, GA. These include the local community action agency (CSRA EOA), as well as the United Way and Antioch Ministries.   The Augusta office of Legal Services can provide free legal defense services, and their phone number is (706) 721-2327.   The East Augusta Community Development Corporation, Safe Homes, and the Salvation Army are all important partners of the services.  </p> <p>     Anyone who wants to apply for a tenancy or who is homeless will need to have an interview.   In order to receive financial assistance from the government in the form of a grant, you must first take this initial step. A consultation will be conducted to see if a family from Richmond County, Georgia, is eligible for housing assistance.   This may be money for rental or utility bill arrears, mortgage payments, and even lease application costs.  </p> <p>     There is not a lot of money available for this project.   There are only certain expenses that tenants will have to pay that the Emergency Solution Grant program will cover.   Some of them may have to do directly with preventing the eviction (such as rent) while others are related to stabilization, such as credit repair or legal bills.   Each application is evaluated to determine what, if anything, is included.  </p> <p>     If you don't pay your rent or your utility bills, your landlord might give you an eviction notice.   The city ordinance in Augusta, Georgia permits and allows this to occur and take place, and the state of Georgia's regulations support this too.   If a family needs help to pay for their energy bills, they may be able to get help from LIHEAP.   The HUD funding may help with the situation as well.   There may be grants for utilities like water and electricity.  </p> <p>     Rental arrears can lead to homelessness.   The community will most likely ask for this.   If the applicant has a source of income and can pay future rent, the non-profits may be able to help with some short term expenses.   They will give money to help pay rent so that the eviction will be delayed or stopped.  </p> <p>     Richmond County/Augusta Legal Services can help you with your legal issue.   Lawyers will offer free support to residents who have received a pay or quit notice.   The ESG grants can cover the costs of any lawyer's fees, whether for court appearances or document review.   Although they try to offer this for free, there may be a small charge in some cases.  </p> <p>     To qualify for low income housing, tenants must earn below a certain amount of money. This can vary depending on the type of housing, but typically low income housing is reserved for those who are considered low income by the government. This includes families with children, seniors, and people with disabilities.   Each agency, such as CSRA, will need to provide evidence that this is the case.   This means that whether or not the applicant is eligible for aid will depend on their personal circumstances.  </p> <p>     Augusta homeless families can find new homes.   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides services to address housing crises.   There is money available for security deposits or short-term stays in motels, but other basic needs like food and clothing for a job are also covered.  </p> <p>     This type of help will be offered to anyone, regardless of how they became homeless.   Assistance is offered if they were evicted or lost their home to foreclosure.   Some applicants may be immigrants or women who have left their homes to escape domestic violence.

Refinancing a loan can help save money on lower payments.   Refinancing an automobile loan is less expensive, faster, and simpler than refinancing a home mortgage.   This means that you do not need a formal appraisal of your home's value and you will usually find out if you have been approved for a loan within one hour of applying online.  </p> <p>     Banks and lenders work together to give you a new car loan.   Many different financial companies offer pre-approved loans to people who meet certain criteria. Some of these companies include Ally, Wells Fargo, Chase, and others.   It is usually better for the lender if the borrower works with them to modify their car loan, rather than allowing the borrower to default.   If you have poor credit, you can still lower your monthly car payment by refinancing your loan.  </p> <p>     This new financing pays off your existing automobile loan, so you will still have one payment to make each month.

You may not have had the best credit scores at the time or had trouble getting financing.   The automobile dealer told you that the interest rate for a five-year loan for a $23,000 car would be 8 percent.   This means that your monthly payments are currently $465.  </p> <p>     If you're looking to lower your monthly car payment, you might want to consider auto refinancing.

Be sure to read the fine print of any contract before signing.  </p> <p>     When you refinance your auto loan, you will typically need to pay fees to transfer the title of the loan and to re-register your car.

Middlemen, such as dealers, almost always increase the interest rates on loans, making the financing more expensive for the borrower.   The company will charge the buyer a higher rate to make a profit.  </p> <p>     This means that they are trying to sell you additional products and services beyond the car itself.   Many companies do not make much money on selling the car, but they are profitable due to these extra services.   An auto dealer can make a lot of money by offering loans to customers. This is because shoppers are getting better at finding the best car prices online, and it is becoming harder for the dealer to make money on the sale of the car itself.  </p> <p>     Refinancing your car loan can help reduce your monthly payments, which may be especially helpful for borrowers whose credit scores have improved since they originally bought their car.   The person may have qualified for a lower interest rate on their loan when they first got it, but circumstances may have changed so that they now qualify for a lower rate.   This is more common than not, and it is usually because borrowers have been making regular, timely payments.  </p> <p>     There are many options available for refinancing a car loan, even for families with low credit.   With more companies offering financial services, there is more competition to get the best terms for products like loans. This includes companies like Paypal, which offers digital financial services. As the market for financial products becomes more competitive, the prices (i.e. interest rates) offered by providers tend to become more affordable for consumers.  </p> <p>     If you have a long-term loan on your car, you may be able to lower your payments by refinancing.   What may happen is that the person's financial situation or credit scores have improved, and the bank may provide them with a shorter term loan (while at the same time lowering their payments) or they can get other assistance from the lender.   This approach can also help them to own more equity in a shorter period of time.  </p> <p>     There may be times when the car payment will not be affordable, even if you refinance the auto loan.   It is possible that the household's income has decreased significantly or that their credit scores are so poor that a bank would not approve the loan.   The owner might not want the truck or car anymore, so refinancing would not make sense.   In these cases, the borrower may still need some form of transportation for work or other reasons. There are charities and non-profits that can help provide a free car.  </p><h2>If refinancing my car loan to save money is such a great deal, why don't more people do it?</h2> <p>    This is a difficult question to answer.  This is a tough question to answer.   Many people are not aware that they can refinance their car loan, which is why it is not more widely used.   One of the main reasons people don't refinance their home loans is because they think it will be a long and difficult process, or that it will be expensive.   However, those two barriers are not true.  </p> <p>     Applying for this only takes a few minutes and is the only risk you face.   You can find out if you can lower your car note payment by doing a little research.   Most banks and companies will provide a response to your application within a relatively short amount of time.   As mentioned, it is quick and easy to try.   This means that, although there may be some costs associated with refinancing your car loan, you are likely to save money each month on your payments.  </p> <p>     Refinancing your auto loan to lower your interest rates and monthly payments will save you money in the long run.   There is no downside to trying this, and you can use the money you save to pay other monthly bills.  </p>"

This can help you pay off bills, consolidate debt, make home improvements, or get money for any other purpose you may need it for.   Where can I find information on how to get a loan?  </p><h2>How to get a bad credit home equity loan</h2> <p>     There are plenty of lenders who will offer home equity loans to people with low credit scores, you just have to look around and do your research.   It can be time-consuming to compare rates and terms from multiple lenders and submit applications to them.   It takes time to apply.  </p> <p>     This means that if you have bad credit and are looking for a home equity loan, you may have to pay a higher interest rate than someone with good credit.

Contact all the large banks in the US.   If it makes sense for your situation, you could get in touch with a local bank or credit union.

Bank of America and Countrywide distribute foreclosure funds.," <p>     Bank of America and Countrywide are preparing to mail out $7.46 million in restitution to Texas families who were tricked, lied to, or encouraged to take on risky home mortgages they could not afford.

Bank of America is helping its customers who are experiencing hardship by providing them with resources to help them get through difficult times. Customers are receiving help from these resources as part of hardship programs.  </p><h2>How people are getting help from Bank of America hardship programs.</h2> <p>     An individual recently completed a settlement with B of A.   They were two months behind on their bills when they contacted the bank.   They cut their debt significantly by reducing it by $18,000.   The customer insisted on the offer they made to the bank and refused to budge.   The person said that they had talked with an attorney and found out that they could file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but that they would rather pay off some of their debt.  </p> <p>     A customer had an account that was not keeping up with the regular monthly payments and was about 8 months overdue.   They repeatedly called Bank of America and requested to speak with a supervisor.   After a few phone calls, Bank of America started a process that eventually lowered their balance by about 75%.   They also allowed the customer to defer some credit card payments as part of a program.   These people were easy to work with.  </p> <p>    The total interest would have been paid over 5 years.The customer would have paid $25,500 in interest if they had five years to pay off their debt.   The person on the phone said that they are struggling to make their monthly payments.   He said that his wife lost her job and that this resulted in their having less income. He then went over the details of their expenses.    Bank of America offered a deal in response.   It involved them cancelling their credit card and reducing the interest rate to 5%.   This lowered their monthly payment to $586 over the course of 60 months.   This offer allowed them to pay less interest, which saved them money.  </p> <p>     The person settled two credit card accounts that were with BOA.   The first settlement was resolved quickly and easily.   The agreement was made at the 180 day mark to settle for 25% of the balance. They were given 3 months to pay it off. The monthly payment was lowered and more time was provided as part of the Bank of America deferral program.  </p> <p>     The second account was more difficult to pay off, and it took a year to pay it off. The account was settled at 35% of the balance. No fees were charged.   The person tried to work out a hardship plan with them before they got into so much trouble and needed to settle, but they did not cooperate.   Their credit scores decreased a lot, but if they had filed for bankruptcy, it would have been worse.  </p> <p>     This customer was more polite in asking for help with their situation.   The bank was contacted in regards to forbearance and interest rate reductions.   In addition to that, the customer always answered when Bank of America called to ask about the account balance.   They told the company that they could only afford to pay 25% of the bill right now, but that they would be willing to pay more if the company gave them more time. They also said that there was no guarantee that they would have the money to pay more in the future.  </p> <p>     The customer kept telling the collector very politely and consistently that they would pay.   The person explained that they are responsible for paying the bills, but they don't have the money at the moment.   According to Bank of America, credit scores will be negatively affected, but they were already in poor condition.   They paid $10,000 for a $55,000 debt.  </p> <p>     This account holder missed three payments and now faces penalties.   Basically, what they are saying is that when you call Bank of America about their hardship program, don't agree to the first offer they make.   The first offer was for a 5.5% fixed interest rate over 5 years, with a monthly payment of $180.   The customer said that they could not afford to pay $180, as they needed the money to cover basic necessities such as food, utilities and gas for their car.  </p> <p>     The bank offered me a 0% interest rate for 58 months and my monthly payment would be $160.   The lender is reducing interest rates as part of the emergency hardship program available on their credit cards.   It may be beneficial to negotiate further instead of accepting the first offer.  </p><h2>Applying for credit card hardship from BOA</h2> <p>     Call Bank of America at (800) 500-5306 to learn about your options for deferring payments or getting other help.

Bank of America home mortgage loan forbearance.," <p>     The Bank of America's forbearance program allows homeowners who are experiencing a short-term, temporary financial hardship or crisis to remain in their home and avoid foreclosure. The homeowner will need to pay back any mortgage help they got from forbearance.   If you need help, repairs are a possible solution for people who are experiencing a short-term hardship.   This is not a permanent fix.  </p> <p>     The main objective of Bank of America's forbearance program is to assist homeowners by temporarily suspending or reducing their mortgage payments.  Forbearance is a period of time, usually 3 to 6 months, during which a lender agrees to not require payments on a loan.  </p><h2>Terms of forbearance from Bank of America</h2> <p>     To qualify for forbearance, the applicant must have a temporary financial hardship or short-term crisis that impacts their ability to make their monthly mortgage payments.   Some examples of financial hardships include losing your job, having your hours at work reduced, or experiencing a natural disaster.  </p> <p>     A forbearance may be offered if the homeowner's situation is temporary and there is a chance of resolution in the near future.  Another example would be if the applicant experiences a decrease in income due to a change in job status.  Some examples of circumstances that could lead to a decrease in household income include if the applicant has a short-term medical condition or a change in job status.   If the homeowner is unable to live in their home because of a natural disaster, such as a flood, and they are waiting for an insurance payment to cover the costs of additional living expenses that may be incurred as a result of it, this would be another example.   Some homeowners have had their work hours cut back due to the weak economy.   Some examples of when Bank of America would consider offering a homeowner forbearance are if the homeowner is experiencing a temporary financial hardship due to a job loss, illness, or death in the family. Forbearance may also be an option if the homeowner is behind on their mortgage payments but are working with a housing counselor to develop a plan to get back on track.  </p> <p>     In order to be eligible for this program, applicants must have a good history of making monthly mortgage payments and have a good standing account with Bank of America.  </p> <p>     To apply, you will need to call the bank and explain your financial situation.

This will be required when the individual's situation improves.   If the homeowner falls behind on their monthly housing payment, they will be required to repay the past due amount for the months they have not paid.   The mortgage holder will need to pay the interest, principle, property taxes, and any homeowners insurance.  </p><h2>How to apply for BOA forbearance programs</h2> <p>     To start, you will need to contact Bank of America at 1.800.669.0102.  </p>"

Foreclosure assistance checks from Countrywide and Bank of America.," <p>   Bank of America has begun to tell homeowners about the foreclosure help that is available to them.   The customers who are eligible would have received their mortgage from Countrywide Financial Corp.   They will begin to issue checks to homeowners during the first quarter of 2010.  </p> <p>     This foreclosure relief program is just one of three different ways to get help. This program helps you by giving you money to pay your mortgage and avoiding foreclosure. The other two programs are refinancing and modification.   The 2008 agreement between Bank of America, Countrywide, and various state Attorney Generals across the country had three components.  </p> <p>     The second part of the program, called the National Homeownership Retention Program, is designed to help up to 400,000 borrowers across the nation who financed their homes with payment option adjustable rate or subprime mortgages serviced by Countrywide to establish both affordable and sustainable monthly mortgage payments.   Bank of America agreed to a settlement with numerous state attorneys generals last fall that would provide $150 million in foreclosure and mortgage relief to certain homeowners who experienced a foreclosure, short sale, or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure after signing up for a Countrywide home mortgage.   The National Homeownership Retention Program is a government initiative that helps homeowners keep their homes. The program provides counseling and support to homeowners who are struggling to make their mortgage payments. The program also works with lenders to help homeowners modify their loans and avoid foreclosure.  </p><h3>Am I eligible for the Retention Program?</h3> <p>     There are some conditions that must be met in order to receive aid.   To qualify for the settlement and checks from Bank of America, borrowers must have originated a Countrywide Financial mortgage between January 2004 and December 2007.   The borrower's home must have gone through foreclosure, short sale, or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure at some point between January 2004 and December 2008.   The homeowner was forced to take out a sub-prime loan or pay option loan from Countrywide and later lost their home. If you are an eligible borrower and did not receive a letter from your state attorney general, you should contact Bank of America to ask about the program.  </p> <p>     To join the foreclosure relief program, residents of forty states will need to be allocated funds and grants.   If you think you may be eligible for a settlement payment from Bank of America, you should contact your state to find out if you will be receiving a letter or notice about the payment.   The amount of money that needs to be paid will not stay the same.   If you haven't received a letter, you should contact the organization to see if you qualify.    This means that the check will not come right away.   The eligible borrowers will most likely receive their payments from Countrywide and Bank of America in early 2010.   Foreclosed borrowers may also be eligible for assistance to help them move or find a new home.   This means that Countrywide expects to pay approximately $80 million to over 35,000 borrowers in 40 states as part of the foreclosure assistance process. Rust Consulting, a third-party administrator, will be managing this process and will be responsible for sending out notifications to eligible customers and distributing the payments.

Can bankruptcy help save my home?," <p>     Filing for bankruptcy can help you keep your home from being foreclosed on in a few different ways, and give you time to figure out what to do next.   If you are having trouble paying your mortgage and are considering bankruptcy, you should know that filing for bankruptcy will stop the foreclosure process. However, you will still need to find a way to pay off the delinquent mortgage.   This is a short-term solution that allows the individual more time to decide on their next steps.   While the court system reviews their case, it will also usually allow the family to continue to live in the home.  </p><h2>Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 13 bankruptcy</h2> <p>     Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a way to temporarily stop the foreclosure process. This might give you a short period of time to sell or refinance your property.   A chapter 13 bankruptcy is a more serious bankruptcy that will provide you with up to five years to catch up on any missed mortgage payments, or a longer period to sell or refinance your home loan.   The specifics of how this process works will vary depending on your individual financial situation and the terms of your loan.   Filing for bankruptcy may stop the foreclosure process.  </p> <p>     There are many different steps that need to be taken in order to file for a foreclosure. The process can be complicated and time-consuming.   You should always speak to an experienced bankruptcy lawyer in your town or city to determine what you can do.   This link provides more information on the foreclosure process.  </p> <p>     Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a good option for families who want to save their home and get more time to pay off mortgage arrears.   This means that if someone files for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, they will still have to make their normal monthly payments, as well as any extra payments required by the court.   The homeowner needs to have money to pay for this.  </p> <p>     Currently, even if a family files for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, they will still be unable to reduce their mortgage payments or change the terms of their home loan if they are struggling to make these payments.   Under the current bankruptcy law, homeowners can't modify a residential mortgage in bankruptcy court, except to make past-due payments.   If you are considering filing for bankruptcy, it is important to understand when the best time to do so. There are a few factors to consider, such as your financial situation and whether you are eligible to file.  </p><h2>Foreclosure help during bankruptcy from lawyers</h2> <p>     It is always a good idea to talk to a lawyer, non-profit credit counselor, or another professional before starting the bankruptcy process, so you can learn more about what is involved and make sure there are no other options.   Filing for bankruptcy should be one of the last options.   If you don't pay your rent, it could negatively affect your credit score and make it harder to rent or buy a new place in the future.  </p> <p>     There are law firms in every state that offer free advice to struggling homeowners and low income families.   If you are at risk of foreclosure, or are having difficulty making your mortgage payments, you may want to consult with a lawyer. A lawyer can help you explore your options and work with your lender to try to avoid foreclosure. If you are already in the process of foreclosure, a lawyer can help you navigate the process and represent your interests. Finally, if you are considering filing for bankruptcy, a lawyer can advise you on how this will affect your mortgage and your home.   Many legal aid attorneys offer services for free to income-qualified homeowners.  </p> <p>     However, the process and concept of filing bankruptcy is expected to change soon, since Congress is considering changing the bankruptcy law to allow mortgage modifications.   If this change occurs, then bankruptcy court judges would be able to oversee the modification of residential home loans to make the mortgage affordable.  </p> <p>   This regulation, if passed, would allow for modification of home loans. This would include changes to monthly payments, interest rates, mortgage length, and potentially also reducing the loan balance due under specific conditions.   Filing for bankruptcy would reduce the amount a homeowner needs to pay on their loan.  </p>"
File bankruptcy to stop a foreclosure.," <p>     Filing for bankruptcy is an option to stop a foreclosure.   Taking this step could put a foreclosure that may be in process on hold, and it could also reduce your other unpaid debts, if not cancel them.   This will give you more time to pay back your home loan.   This will damage your credit score, but if you start from scratch you can improve it more quickly.  </p> <p>     If you're struggling to make mortgage payments, you should reach out to your lender as soon as possible to discuss your options. Most lenders will not initiate the foreclosure process until you have fallen behind on payments for at least two months, but it's important to review all your options as soon as you start having trouble making payments.   This means that you have 2-4 months to try to save your home using methods such as a short sale, loan forbearance, or a federal government program such as HAMP. You may also be able to do a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  </p> <p>     If you've tried everything else and haven't had any success, you may need to file for bankruptcy to stop or delay foreclosure.   This option involves giving the company some information about yourself so they can create a personalized profile for you.   Filing for bankruptcy should be one of your last options. You should only file for bankruptcy after you have explored and/or applied for all other assistance.  </p><h2>Bankruptcy delays foreclosure.</h2> <p>     This means that the court has recognized that you are eligible to file for bankruptcy and that your case will now move forward.   When you file for bankruptcy, an ""automatic stay"" goes into effect. This means that your lenders and creditors must stop all collection activity against you.   This means that if you are facing foreclosure, or if the foreclosure sale is approaching, the sale of your home will be temporarily postponed while the bankruptcy case is pending.   There is a delay of 3-4 months.   However, there are two possible exceptions.  </p> <p>   Exception number two is the plaintiff's agreement not to oppose the motion.  The first exception is a request to remove the legal restriction. The second exception is the plaintiff's agreement not to oppose the request.   If the bank or lender gets approval from the bankruptcy court to sell the home, it's possible that you might not get the full three-to-four-month delay in the process.   This means that even if your home is scheduled to be sold, the judge may postpone the sale for at least two months.   The creditor may take longer than two months to file a motion that would lift the automatic stay, which would cause further delays.   The homeowner will still be able to live in the home for a few months, even if the situation does not improve. This gives the homeowner time to explore other options.  </p> <p>     If the foreclosure notice has already been filed, the second option is to try to work out a payment plan with the lender.   If a debtor files for bankruptcy, the court may issue an ""automatic stay"" which prevents creditors from taking action against the debtor. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.   More and more states are now requiring that a notice be filed in advance before a foreclosure sale can happen. Your lender can sometimes file to allow the foreclosure to go through.   This may sound complicated, but it's actually not. If someone is behind on their mortgage payments, they may face foreclosure. Foreclosure is a legal process where the homeowner's lender can take back the property.    The homeowner's bank or lender is required by state law to provide at least three months' notice of a foreclosure filing.  Theba  If you file for bankruptcy after two months have passed, the default notice will not apply.   In this case, the three-month period would end after you have been in the bankruptcy process for only one month.   After the set time period, the bank or lender can go to court to ask for permission to foreclose on the home.  </p><h2>Stop foreclosure from chapter 13 bankruptcy</h2> <p>     The last resort to keep your home and stop a foreclosure is to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  </p> <p>     Chapter 13 allows individuals to repay their debts over a period of time through a court-approved repayment plan   What this does is it allows you to pay the ""arrearage"" on your loan, which is the unpaid mortgage payments that are late, over the length of a repayment plan.   The amount of time it takes can vary depending on the situation.   The court will require that you have enough income to pay your current monthly mortgage payment and the arrearage.   This gives you more time.   If you agree to a plan with your lender, and you make all the required mortgage payments on time, you will be able to keep your home and avoid foreclosure.  </p> <p>     Chapter 13 bankruptcy may also allow you to eliminate payments you were required to make on your second or third mortgage.   This means that if you have to sell your home, you may not be able to pay off all of your mortgages and could end up owing money to the bank.   This means that chapter 13 will eliminate any second or third mortgages you may have.  </p> <p>     Chapter 7 clears away debt.   This means that if you have any unpaid debt that is secured by your home, filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy will cancel that debt.   All loans are canceled, including primary mortgages, home equity loans, secured loans, and any subsequent mortgages.  </p> <p>     A chapter 7 bankruptcy is filed by an individual or business that can no longer pay their debts. The bankruptcy court liquidates the debtor's assets to pay off creditors, and the debtor is then discharged from their debts.   There are a few different ways.   You want to speak to a non-profit, government-approved credit counseling agency for free advice on the process.   If you want to learn more about nation non-profits, click here.  </p><h2>Chapter 7 won’t stop a foreclosure</h2> <p>     While bankruptcy may cancel your debt, it will not stop a foreclosure.   The reason this happens is because when you purchased your home, you more than likely signed at least three documents with your lender.   The first document would be a promissory note that states you agree to repay the full mortgage. The second document is known as a security agreement, which would outline what the collateral is for the loan and how it would be used.   If you don't follow the terms of the promissory note, the lien ensures that you will be held responsible.  </p> <p>     When you file for chapter 7 bankruptcy, your personal liability for the debt is removed, but the lien is not.   A chapter 7 bankruptcy filing will eliminate all of your unpaid debt and loans, but any liens associated with them will still remain.   This means that even after going through the foreclosure process, you will likely still have to give up your house.  </p>"
Medical debt causes bankruptcies.," <p>     A recent study by Harvard University found a sharp increase in personal bankruptcies over the last six years, largely due to mounting medical expenses.   There are many more households that are struggling to pay their medical bills or eliminate debts they owe to doctors or hospitals.  </p> <p>     The results of the study suggest that medical debt and bills, in combination with the problems that result from illnesses such as lost wages for the sick and their caregivers, have contributed to a majority of all personal bankruptcies filed in 2007.  </p> <p>     It's not much help to have medical insurance either.   The Harvard study found that even though 80% of bankruptcy filers had health insurance, they were still struggling to pay for healthcare.   Only 20% of those who filed bankruptcy did not have insurance This means that 80% of those who filed bankruptcy did have insurance.  </p> <p>     This study found that medical expenses were a significant contributing factor to bankruptcies.   The number of bankruptcy filings increased, even though there is a law from the federal government that makes it harder for people to get protection from creditors when they owe money, including for medical expenses.  </p><h2>File bankruptcy if have health insurance</h2> <p>     This means that people who declared bankruptcy and had private insurance had an average of $18,000 in medical bills.   People who file for bankruptcy with health insurance are better off than those who file for bankruptcy without health insurance.   They had medical expenses that totaled almost $27,000.   Many people use credit cards to pay their bills, which often have high interest rates.   There are a few things you can do to get rid of medical and credit card debt. One way is to negotiate with your creditors. You can also try to find a lower interest rate on your credit cards, and make sure to pay more than the minimum balance each month. You can also look into debt consolidation or credit counseling.  </p> <p>     Many people who go bankrupt due to medical expenses are middle class.   Becoming sick caused a financial disaster.   Approximately 66% of the participants were homeowners and the majority had some form of college education (i.e. a degree).  </p> <p>     Medical debt was highest among those who sought help from a bankruptcy filing and had neurological disorders and diabetes, including multiple sclerosis.   On average, people with health insurance spent $27,000 on medical care, while those without insurance spent almost $35,000.   This means that for half of the families who filed for bankruptcy because of health care expenses, the largest expense was from the hospital.  </p> <p>     One of the study's findings was that health insurance does not necessarily improve one's health.   This coverage does not mean that someone will not go bankrupt if they get sick.   There are several reasons why health insurance can be expensive. Many plans have high deductibles, meaning that you have to pay a lot of money out of pocket before the insurance company will start to pay for your care. Additionally, you may have to pay high co-payments for each doctor's visit or prescription, and there are often services that are not covered by insurance at all.   There are many people who have insurance but still end up with high medical bills.  </p><h2>Get help to prevent bankruptcy from medical debts</h2> <p>     This means that if you have unpaid medical bills, the hospital or doctor may not try very hard to get you to pay them back.   Bad publicity for the hospital is caused by aggressive collection tactics by a medical provider, in particular a non-profit facility. A second reason is many doctors do not spend as many resources towards debt collection.  </p> <p>     This means that consumers often have time on their side as the debt may not be collected as aggressively.   They may have other choices available to them other than filing for bankruptcy.   Patients in need of debt relief should first look into credit counseling from a non-profit agency. This type of counseling takes a holistic approach to debts, including medical bills, and creates a plan to get the patient out of debt.   They will also tell a person the good and bad things about filing for bankruptcy and give other help.   There are agencies that can help you manage your credit. They can provide services such as counseling and help you create a plan to improve your credit.  </p>"
