Back then, it looked very different from the warehouses we recognize today.</p><p>The business actually started out as a mail-order catalog, through which customers could browse and order household goods. </p><p>However, while IKEA initially only sold items such as pens, wallets, and picture frames, within five years Kamprad was able to expand his services and offer furniture, too. </p><p>The company name combines the founder’s initials with the first initial of Elmtaryd, the farm he grew up on, and Agunnaryd, which was a nearby village. </p><p>IKEA operates under the same name in all countries. However, it would appear that a lot of people mispronounce it, particularly in America. The correct pronunciation is ee-KAY-uh, although many say eye-KEY-uh instead. </p><p>The first US IKEA store opened in 1985, in a shopping mall just outside of Philadelphia. By this point, the well-planned warehouses and low-priced stock had become a distinctive part of the IKEA brand. </p><p>The hype around the company preceded its arrival in the states. However, even though expectations were high before the store had even landed, IKEA more than lived up to them. </p><p>IKEA received an overwhelmingly positive reception in the US, and the first IKEA store quickly became immensely popular. </p><p>At one point in its opening year, the store actually ran out of merchandise and had to shut up shop until the following week. As a result of such fanaticism, the company made $50,000,000 in sales in its first 12 months. </p><p>Since its inception in 1940s Sweden, IKEA has continued to expand within its home country, as well as in the US and other countries across the world. </p><p>By the end of August 2020, there were 445 IKEA stores globally. The majority are located in Germany and the United States, and there are plans to open plenty more warehouses in the coming years.  </p><h3>IKEA’s Popularity In The United States</h3><p>Since coming to America in 1985, IKEA has made its mark. Here’s how the brand gained and retained its popularity in the US.  </p><p>At the moment, there are 52 IKEA warehouses in the US, but they are not present in every state. As it stands, only 27 states and territories have IKEA warehouses, meaning that some residents are better catered for than others. </p><p>States that do not yet have an IKEA store include those that are more remote, such as Hawaii and Alaska, and even some larger states like South Carolina, New Mexico, and Montana. </p><p>Of all the 27 US states and territories that have an IKEA warehouse within their borders, California has by far the most. </p><p>With eight locations, California’s warehouses account for around 15% of the total number of IKEA stores in the country. And, California can also boast the largest IKEA store in the country, with Burbank’s IKEA covering 456,000 square feet. </p><p>One major draw customers have to IKEA is the excellent value-for-money offered in-store. In fact, many products similar to those sold in the first US store go for the same price today, despite inflation. </p><p>Amazingly, some even sell for less than their original price. As a result, you can often buy IKEA furniture for around half the price of comparable products sold by competitors. </p><p>It’s not just the merchandise that is appealingly low-cost. IKEA’s in-store food courts also offer customers great value for money.</p><p>For their iconic Swedish meatballs with sides, you can expect to pay around $5.99, while their breakfast plate will cost you just $2. </p><p>And, it’s cheap for a reason. When founder Ingvar Kamprad introduced food courts to his stores in 1958, he quite rightly predicted that well-fed customers would lead to an increase in sales. </p><p>The value for money that IKEA offers doesn’t stop at food and merchandise. The company also has a membership program called IKEA Family, which gives shoppers additional discounts and access to events and workshops. </p><p>IKEA Family is free to join for shoppers around the world, rewarding members simply for being members, rather than based on what they spend in-store. </p><h3>IKEA Logistics Facts And Statistics</h3><p>IKEA’s global scale necessitates an advanced logistical operation. Read on for the latest information on how the business runs. </p><p>IKEA champions responsibility and ethics, dedicated to making a positive impact. So, it has a supplier code of conduct in place called IWAY, which has been devised with best practices and international standards in mind. </p><p>The IWAY sets out guidelines for environmental, social, and working conditions, which it expects all IKEA suppliers and service providers to stick to. </p><p>The low-cost furniture for sale in IKEA’s stores is such good value in part because of the scale of the chain’s operations. </p><p>By buying materials in massive quantities, IKEA is able to maximize the amount it gets for its money. Plus, by only dealing in flat-packed products, more can be shipped, stored, and sold at any one time. </p><p>In keeping with IKEA’s overarching company goals, distribution operations are designed to reduce fuel and energy consumption, so as to be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. </p><p>There are at least 10 distribution centers in North America alone. Each one stores IKEA’s easy-to-transport flat-pack furniture, which is shipped by rail and sea, wherever possible. </p><p>In 2020, IKEA partnered with Verity, a world leader in autonomous indoor drone systems. Together, they devised a technological solution that would cut down on time-consuming manual processes in IKEA’s warehouses. </p><p>The result was an automated solution for warehouse inventory checks. Using drones with cameras and sophisticated algorithms, IKEA is now able to collect inventory data, without the need for manual labor. </p><p>IKEA has been upping its investments in technology elsewhere as well, for example in a new distribution center in Montreal, which is intended to service markets in both Canada and the US. </p><p>Here, 12 robots, 30 storage and retrieval machines, and a 750-meter-long floor conveyor system work together to improve efficiency and cut down on energy consumption. </p><p>The new Montreal distribution center was designed specifically to support IKEA’s e-commerce operations. </p><p>With the most up-to-date automated systems, designed by SSI SCHAEFER, the warehouse is able to accommodate different order types and respond quickly to requests, even at peak times. </p><p>IKEA can deliver products across the US, even to states that do not have IKEA stores. So, most US residents will be able to get IKEA furniture delivered straight to their door. The only exceptions are those that live in extremely isolated areas, such as Alaska and Hawaii. </p><p>IKEA’s delivery services are supported by around 10,000 vehicles globally. However, there is no set number of delivery trucks and vans that service the US, because IKEA doesn’t actually have its own delivery fleet. </p><p>The vehicles that carry out IKEA’s home deliveries in the US are not the company’s own. Rather, IKEA partners with delivery companies such as DHL, UPS, and FedEx, and the IWAY Code Of Conduct ensures these partners operate in line with the chain’s standards. </p><p>Because of these strong partnerships, IKEA is able to deliver a large number of furniture pieces to a customer’s door for a flat fee of $49.</p><p>IKEA also partners with a company called TaskRabbit, to offer assembly services to customers who need it. </p><h3>IKEA’s Worldwide Operation Statistics</h3><p>It’s not just the US that loves IKEA. These are the latest insights into IKEA’s global operations. </p><p>IKEA has warehouses in 55 countries, with more openings all the time. One of the most recent stores to open was in Ljubljana in Slovenia, the country’s first. </p><p>And, there are plans in the pipeline to open up eight more stores in the coming years. As a result, Colombia, New Zealand, and Oman are all due to get their first IKEA stores by 2025. </p><p>While the US has its fair share of IKEA locations, it’s Germany that has the most. The country is home to 53 IKEA stores, with four in Berlin alone. However, it was in Munich that the country’s first warehouse opened in 1974. </p><p>Valued at around $48.1 billion, IKEA is the most valuable furniture retailer in the world. </p><p>And, as of 2020, it is also the fourth most valuable retailer in the world, after Home Depot, Alibaba, and Amazon, which takes the top spot. </p><p>IKEA attracts hundreds of millions of customers worldwide every year. In fact, in 2020 alone, more than 800 million customers shopped at an IKEA store.</p><p>During a year in which many stores had to temporarily close in response to the pandemic, this number is hugely impressive. </p><p>However, in years when operations are in full swing, IKEA has had closer to one billion customers. With IKEA expanding into more and more countries, it seems likely that the furniture retailer will surpass the one billion figure in the coming years. </p><p>Almost all IKEA products are named after Swedish words. And, you will find that each item of stock has the same name, no matter what country you find it in. This helps to simplify inventory and streamline global operations. </p><h3>IKEA Employee Statistics</h3><p>Is IKEA as loved by employees as it is by shoppers? These facts and figures will give you an answer. </p><p>As the number of IKEA stores has expanded over the years, so has the number of employees that work for the company. In 2020, almost 220,000 people worked for IKEA across the world, in stores, distribution centers, offices, and more. </p><p>This number has increased dramatically since 2013 when IKEA had closer to 150,000 employees. </p><p>IKEA is dedicated to employee welfare. As part of its commitment to its workers, the chain continues to invest in working conditions and pay packages. </p><p>Resultantly, IKEA has been recognized across the world for its high employee satisfaction rates. In its home country, Sweden, it was voted the company people most want to work for at the 2015 Randstad Awards. </p><p>IKEA believes in fair treatment and equal opportunities, regardless of age, gender identity, race, or any other aspect of a person’s identity. The IKEA ethos is that its staff should represent its diverse global customer base. </p><p>So, the company is committed to becoming a leader in equality and will consider all applicants for employment-based only on their qualifications and suitability for the job. </p><p>Beyond fair wages and good working conditions, IKEA also offers its employees a whole range of benefits. For starters, there is a 15% co-worker discount workers can access from the day they start. </p><p>In addition, IKEA employees also get pet insurance, paid parental leave, and exclusive meal deal offers. </p><h3>What Challenges Has IKEA Faced? </h3><p>There’s no doubt that IKEA is hugely successful. But, the furniture retail giant still has challenges to contend with. </p><p>Even though IKEA has been investing in its e-commerce operations, online ordering and home delivery still fall short a lot of the time. This has been particularly problematic in the face of a sharp increase in online orders, as the coronavirus crisis caused physical stores to close.  </p><p>With reports of poor customer service and unfulfilled orders, IKEA has come under fire for its poor e-commerce.  </p><p>IKEA’s furniture is cheap and, in most cases, good quality, too. But, over the years, certain products have been found to pose a danger to customers and their young children. </p><p>MALM dressers have received perhaps the most attention, as eight children have died since 1989 as a result of them tipping over. </p><h3>IKEA Emerging Market Trends And Statistics</h3><p>IKEA has big plans for its future. Here’s how it plans to expand operations in the coming years.</p><p>IKEA’s commitment to sustainability is present in all it does. And, it has a strategy in place that maps out its future sustainability plans. </p><p>By 2030, IKEA wants to shift to an entirely circular business model, in which it will only use renewable or recycled materials for all of its products. The company also wants to become climate positive by the same year, actively helping to protect resources and ecosystems. </p><p>As part of its sustainability initiatives, IKEA has upped its investment in electric delivery vans, even though the company does not own its own fleet. </p><p>By 2025, IKEA wants all last-mile deliveries to be shipped in electric vehicles and is working with its delivery partners to accomplish this goal. </p><p>IKEA puts its money where its mouth is when it comes to being eco-conscious. In 2020, its parent company the Ingka Group announced a $712 million investment into sustainability initiatives. </p><p>A third of this investment will go towards renewable energy, another third will be spent on warehouse sustainability efforts, and another will be invested in innovative start-ups. </p><p>The drive towards being more environmentally friendly doesn’t just happen behind the scenes. Customers who drive electric cars can also get involved, as more than 75% of IKEA stores worldwide have electric charging points as of 2018. </p><p>In 2020, IKEA announced that it was planning on opening malls in the US. With IKEA stores as a focal point, the malls (known as Ingka Centers) will also house stores that appeal to their local communities. </p><p>There are currently 50 Ingka Centers in the world right now, including one under development in San Francisco. </p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>IKEA is one of the biggest and best-known retailers in the world, with 445 stores in different countries, and plans to open more in the coming years. </p><p>In spite of this constant drive to expand, the company remains committed to environmental initiatives, its focus on employee welfare, and offering affordably priced, high quality furniture to its millions of customers.  </p>",ikea

15 Things To Know Before Buying a TV From Costco,"<p>Costco is known for great prices on high-ticket items, including televisions. The retail giant usually carries the best deal around when you’re in the market for a new TV. But is the deal really as sweet as it seems? </p><p>You need to know a few things before you purchase your new flatscreen or smart TV from Costco. Read on to get the full scoop.</p><h2>15 Things To Know Before Buying a TV From Costco</h2><h3>1. Costco Has Many TV Options</h3><p>Costco has one of the largest selections of TV sizes available in any big box store and carries prominent brand-name televisions (Hisense, LG, Samsung, Sony, VIZIO, SANUS, WireLogic, etc). </p><p>Typically, their sizes range from less than 40-inch screens to almost 90-inch screens. </p><h3>2. Certain TV Options Are Limited At Costco</h3><p>While Costco does sell prominent brands of TVs in their warehouses, there aren’t as many options (brands, size, and screen type) when compared to Best Buy or Walmart.</p><h3>3. Sometimes A “Deal” Is Not A Deal</h3><p>Costco works out deals with major companies to bring you lower prices with special deals. For example, Costco will sell you a television at a reduced cost if you buy a live-streaming package with one of their participating data companies. </p><p>However, their deals are sometimes not so great. In fact, they often charge more through their “deals” than many of the other live-streaming options that are available.</p><p>So to save some extra money, it might be worth investing in just the TV by itself and BYO your own streaming services.</p><h3>4. Package Deals Can Be Tricky</h3><p>Costco offers lower prices than most other retailers, but there is a catch…</p><p>As an example, customers may have to sign a two-year agreement with one of their participating companies like AT&T. If you don’t take the two-year agreement, you don’t get the special pricing. </p><p>As well, while monthly costs may be reasonably low in the first year, they often rise in the second year of the agreement. </p><p>Then you’re stuck in a deal you can’t easily get out of, paying prices you didn’t agree to.</p><h3>5. Costco Has A Limited Return Window on TVs</h3><p>Most Costco merchandise can be returned at any time for any reason, and you get your money back, no questions asked. However, this is not the case with Costco televisions. </p><p>The return window for televisions purchased from Costco is only 90 days. So, if after 90 days you decide you don’t like this TV, too bad. You cannot return it for a refund of your money.</p><p>However, Costco does provide very generous TV warranties (see more below!).</p><h3>6. Costco Offers A Superior TV Warranty</h3><p>Most manufacturers offer a one-year warranty on any television purchased from one of their stores. Costco on the other hand doubles this offer for a two-year warranty on any television they sell! </p><p>For televisions larger than 37 inches, Costco has the option of a three-year warranty plus technical support, for an added fee, of course. </p><h3>7. Protection Is Extra For TVs</h3><p>In addition to the extended warranty Costco offers, there are also protection plans available to cover the malfunction of physical features. </p><p>Of course, these cost extra and must be purchased within 90 days of the TV purchase date. </p><p>These protection plans provide five years of protection as Costco has a partnership with Allstate for these plans. </p><p>For a quick breakdown of this protection, the first two years are covered by Costco and the other three years are provided by Allstate. </p><h3>8. Membership Is Required For Buying TVs</h3><p>Like many club-type retailers, Costco’s special pricing is dependent upon a Costco membership. Simply put, no Costco member’s card, means you cannot shop in-store.</p><p>Now for most people, this probably doesn’t seem like a big deal. A Costco membership usually costs about $50 per year. So, most people would consider a membership the only logical route to great deals. </p><p>And basically, it is. However, if you don’t live near a Costco or don’t do most of your shopping there, it probably wouldn’t save you enough money to justify the membership fee.</p><h3>9. Online Costco Matches Physical Costco For TVs And Other Products</h3><p>If driving to a store and spending hours comparing televisions is not your idea of a fun Saturday, you can just go to Costco.com and find everything you would find in a physical store. </p><p>There are several advantages to this: </p><ul><li>It’s easier to compare sets online than in a store. </li><li>Pricing is the same. </li><li>Shipping is free. </li><li>You can avoid long lines at checkout. </li><li>You aren’t as likely to impulse buy. </li><li>You can skip the pressure sales speech to upgrade your membership plan. </li></ul><p>To learn how to price match against Costco’s own pricing, you can see my full guide here!</p><h3>10. Price Matching Other Retailers For TVs Is Almost Impossible At Costco</h3><p>There is one little trick that you need to know before buying a television at Costco. The model numbers on their TVs will often not match the model numbers on the same models at other stores.</p><p> This is because if the model numbers are the same, you can insist on a price match. </p><p>Say another retailer has the TV for less money, but you want Costco’s fantastic warranty. So, you ask Costco to match the other retailer’s price. </p><p>Since the model numbers are not the same, Costco can refuse to price match. Because technically, it’s a different model TV than the one at the other retailer.</p><h3>11. Costco Provides TV Tech Support On Select Days And Times</h3><p>While Costco does offer free technical support for any issues you may experience with your new television, there are limitations. </p><p>You’d better hope your problems occur between 5 AM and 10 PM on a weekday. Because tech support is off the clock after 10 PM every night and on holidays. </p><p>This can prove to be most distressing if you’re stuck at home over a holiday weekend with a malfunctioning television. Or if your set breaks down during your favorite midnight show.</p><h3>12. TV Delivery and Set-Up Not Included</h3><p>Costco does not include delivery and set-up in their bundle of services offered with a TV purchase. For most people, this probably isn’t a big deal.</p><p> But for the elderly or for someone who already has more than they can get done, this service would be quite helpful. </p><p>Televisions are not known for being lightweight. And, of course, the bigger they are, the more they weigh. For someone with health issues who can no longer lift heavy things, set-up might be highly problematic.  </p><p>As well, for those who drive small vehicles, getting a large television into their vehicle might be a challenge. Having delivery and set-up included could be a significant bonus for many people.</p><p>So while this is not a dealbreaker, it is something to be aware of.</p><h3>13. Not All Credit Cards Are Accepted</h3><p>Since a television is a rather large purchase, likely, you won’t have the cash to pay upfront. Most often, this type of purchase goes onto a credit card.</p><p>The thing is, Costco does not accept all major cards (Amex and MasterCard) as they accept only cards that are backed by Visa.</p><p>To spare yourself some embarrassment, you may want to double-check your card’s issuer before attempting to purchase that Costco 60-inch flatscreen with it.</p><h3>14. Costco Prices May Be the Best Even When They’re Higher</h3><p>Often, Costco will price a television slightly higher than another retailer. At first glance, the lowest price may seem to be the best. </p><p>But when you consider the excellent warranty you get with Costco, you almost always decide in Costco’s favor. The extended warranty puts money back in your pocket for a year longer than other retailers do.</p><h3>15. Buy A Costco TV And Get A Gift Card</h3><p>By signing up for internet deals through companies with which Costco partners, you are rewarded with a Costco gift card. Depending on the particular deal you signed up for, you can get a gift card for as much as $200! </p><p>To learn more about buying products from Costco, you can also see my guides on buying furniture and alcohol from Costco.</p><h3>Research Is Key To Getting Deals </h3><p>As with any purchase, there will be great and not-so-great deals at Costco when it comes to buying your new television. Do your research, and be sure to read the fine print before making any major purchase. While Costco usually has the best deals, sometimes you can find a better deal somewhere else.</p>",costco
